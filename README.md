# Public Art Registry

**Public Art Registry** is a production-ready community-driven platform that empowers people to become Citizen Cultural Archivists. The goal is to document, preserve, and share public and cultural artworks so they remain accessible to everyone, forever.

## üåç Project Vision

Cities are filled with cultural landmarks‚Äîmurals, sculptures, mosaics, tiny libraries, installations, and more. Too often, these works fade away, get demolished, or disappear when privately managed websites go offline. Public Art Registry provides a public, open platform to:

- **Discover** public art near you on an interactive map.
- **Document** artworks by uploading photos, notes, and details.
- **Preserve** submissions by contributing metadata under CC0 to the open commons.
- **Contribute** to long-lived open datasets such as OpenStreetMap and Wikidata (future phases).

This ensures that the cultural history of our cities outlives any single platform or institution.
