    "title": "Weekend Chime",
    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: Weekend Chime is a sound installation that plays notes based on the chorus of Loverboy&rsquo;s iconic song, Working for the Weekend every Friday at 5 p.m., to signal the end of the traditional work week and the beginning of the weekend. More specifically, the chime sounds the two-note melody used by singer Mike Reno while singing the word &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; in the chorus that gives the song its title. The artwork explores themes of class, labour struggles and the versatility of pop music.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lyrics seem to loosely depict a kind of social-recreational interaction, the artist has interpreted the song as an unofficial sing-along anthem for the weekend itself and for working people. The artist Brady Cranfield says &ldquo;I see a parallel between the way everyday people use, reuse, remake and occupy that space and the way that we use, reuse, remake and occupy pop songs. Weekend Chime will hopefully act as a reminder that we&rsquo;re all workers, the true producers of value in the world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLearn more about this arwork here: Weekend Chime brochure (PDF)\n\n**Description**: Weekend Chime was one of five projects commissioned as part of the Public Art Program&#39;s 2017 Artist-Initiated Public Call. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtpBV_I_Mf0&amp;t=32s\n\n\n\nImported from Vancouver Open Data (registryid: 865)",

    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: &quot;Hong Kong&ndash;based artist Christopher K. Ho&rsquo;s CX 889 pays tribute to the wave of Hong Kong-to-Vancouver immigration between 1989 and 1997. The installation re-stages familiar sights, hazy and half-remembered, from Hong Kong&rsquo;s beloved Kai Tak Airport, which was dismantled a year after the 1997 handover of Hong Kong sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. CX 889 evokes the disorienting but warm reactivation of familiar sights, sounds and scents after a trans-Pacific flight&mdash;a state of unwakefulness that may also inform memories of Vancouver in the 1990s, when immigration and urban development changed the city beyond recognition.&quot;\r\n\r\nArtist project statement courtesy of the Vancouver Art Gallery.\n\n**Description**: Christopher K. Ho&rsquo;s CX 889 is a temporary installation as part of the Offsite series and was on view from June 23, 2022 to October 23, 2022. \r\n\r\nOffsite is an outdoor public art space in the heart of the city. Presenting an innovative program of temporary projects, it is a site for local and international contemporary artists to exhibit works related to the surrounding urban context. Featured artists consider the site-specific potential of art within the public realm and respond to the changing social and cultural conditions of our contemporary world. New projects are installed in the spring and fall of each year.\r\n\r\nOffsite is organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery and funded by the City of Vancouver through the Public Art Program.\n\n\n\nImported from Vancouver Open Data (registryid: 895)",

    "title": "The Dusk Meridian",
    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: The Dusk Meridian is a multimedia installation by the Vancouver&ndash; and Kelowna&ndash;based artist Keith Langergraber. Its principal features are scaled-down representations of two fire towers that are physically close but imaginatively separated: the real-life versions sit on either side of the border that divides Canada and the US at the southern boundary of E.C. Manning Provincial Park. The title refers to the moment in time between the setting of the sun and the onset of darkness and to the geographical location of this phenomenon, which endlessly traverses the rotating surface of the planet. It is also a nod to Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s The Blood Meridian, an apocalyptic neo-biblical novel set in the border between the US and Mexico. These references are reiterated in the phantasmagoric light projected onto the fire towers, the pool of water on which they sit and the wall behind them, evoking a transitional condition somewhere between the setting of the sun and the approach of a catastrophic wildfire. But while the warmth of this light might contrast with the overcast gloom of a Vancouver winter, it offers little in the way of easy comfort.\r\n\r\nLangergraber&rsquo;s work serves as an allegory for crossing a point of no return: passing from light into darkness. Here, the devastation wrought by widespread wildfires&mdash;a force of nature unconstrained by abstractions like national borders&mdash;becomes the norm. The fire towers of The Dusk Meridian can be seen as silent witnesses to this transition, much like barometers measuring climactic change that has already arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Dusk Meridian featured a theatrical lighting component nightly from dusk until dawn.\n\n**Description**: Erwin Wurm is the 19th installation in the Offsite series and was on view from September 20, 2019 to March 22, 2020. \r\n\r\nOffsite is an outdoor public art space in the heart of the city.

    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: &quot;Evann Siebens and Keith Doyle explore how the moving body, whether in solitude or en masse, can become a political act. Incorporating image and sculpture into a multimedia installation, Pedestrian Protest considers themes of gathering and protest along Georgia Street&mdash;a connective artery that runs through the unceded territories of the xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱w&uacute;7mesh (Squamish) and səl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) nations.\r\n\r\nSiebens collaborated with nearly 50 local dancers, visual artists and activists to create 24 media performances that reference a historical or recent protest. Each collaborator&rsquo;s singular artistic voice combines with the others in a chorus of protest and gathering that maps our changing city. Doyle responds to this mapping through his sculptural intervention, referring to the precarious and temporary conditions of Vancouver&rsquo;s constantly changing built environment.\r\n\r\nCollaborating artists include: Margaret Dragu, Man Up Collective (Continental Breakfast, Mx Bukuru, Ponyboy and Vixen Von Flex), Harmonie Rose and romham p&agrave;draig gallacher, Katie Cassady, Justine A.

The work was inspired by the many women in the artist&rsquo;s life who have lifted him up and provided love, guidance, and support. The artist intends for viewers to feel these women&rsquo;s ability to dance through adversity and pain with ferocious dignity and courage. In the artist&rsquo;s own words:\r\n\r\n&ldquo;In each era rises a matriarch. She lives her entire life to serve but she&rsquo;s no servant. She&rsquo;s a weaver. Attendant to a loom made of passed down parts. Its components fashioned generation after generation by glorious women who carry an exquisite vision, one of love and unity. The strands of her cloth are souls. Some have heartbeats, others made up only of memories spliced together with artful abandon. Some strands are copper and gold. Others are beautiful with ends frayed, tattered, or torn. She&rsquo;ll mend them with the fibres of her own frock despite being threadbare itself. Such is the sacrifice her art insists.&rdquo;\n\n**Description**: Platforms: Nine Places for Seeing is a series of temporary public art projects that presented from June 2023 until the end of 2025.\r\n\r\nPlatforms: Nine Places for Seeing commissioned 21 local xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), sḵwx̱w&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and urban Indigenous artists. \r\n\r\nSelected artworks were displayed on the following platforms: \r\n\r\n\r\n\\tBillboards along 6th Avenue between Arbutus and Fir \r\n\\tLight box at &scaron;xʷƛ̓ exən Xwtl&rsquo;a7shn Plaza  \r\n\\tBanners at Vancouver Public Library, Central Branch  \r\n\\tGlass wall at City Centre Canada Line Station  \r\n\\tTransit shelter posters throughout the city \r\n\\tVanLive! video screen, Robson St and Granville St \r\n\\tGlass wall at Marine Drive Canada Line Station \r\n\\tWindows at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre \r\n\\tWindows at the Vancouver Playhouse \r\n\\tGlass Wall at Olympic Village Canada Line Station\r\n\\tGlass Wall at King Edward Canada Line Station\n\n\n\nImported from Vancouver Open Data (registryid: 916)",
