    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: This design originated from a painting I created in 2018. While unfolding a long-neglected canvas, I discovered intricate, beautiful creases that sparked my creativity. Intuitively, I began to paint these lines in green, developing an interesting design around them that resonates with my Indigenous roots. This pattern has been a significant part of my artistic journey for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, I incorporated this design into a small fashion collection at the John Casablancas Institute, and I am excited to revisit it now as I expand into a new collection, which I hope to unveil soon. This design feels like a constant companion in my work, deeply connected to my identity, and I anticipate it will remain a part of my artistic expression for years to come.\n\n**Description**: Launch Pad provides opportunities for recent xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), sḵwx̱w&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) and Vancouver-based graduates from art and design institutions to enter into the field of public art. From October 2024 - October 2025, five billboard spaces along the Arbutus Greenway, between Fir Street and Burrard Street on 6th Avenue, featured the works of 20 recent graduates. These exhibitions rotated, with each series displayed for approximately six weeks.\n\n\n\nImported from Vancouver Open Data (registryid: 935)",

    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: This piece was created over several weeks using a unique dyeing and painting technique involving ammonia and acrylic paint.\r\n\r\nBy leaving the imagery unresolved, my paintings invite viewers to actively participate in exploring the latent forms and shapes throughout. This approach encourages the audience to engage their own visual memory, ensuring a unique experience for each viewer.\r\n\r\nI believe these moments of focus, reflection, and interruption offer opportunities to re-evaluate our relationship to form, painting, and ourselves in relation to the work and the surrounding space.\n\n**Description**: Launch Pad provides opportunities for recent xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), sḵwx̱w&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) and Vancouver-based graduates from art and design institutions to enter into the field of public art.

    "description": "**Artist Project Statement**: Connected by the Pacific Ocean, Vancouver and Hong Kong are both fluid gathering places. These two port cities have long been intertwined. On May 1,1983, the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific landed at Vancouver&rsquo;s YVR International Airport for the first time. The migration of not only people and objects, but sounds, smells, textures, tastes, temperatures, and languages have flourished through dedicated flight paths back-and-forth.\r\n\r\nPaint Swatches for a Home seeped out of a family emergency that led me back to Hong Kong after being unable to return since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Reflecting on the paint swatch-walls found in home renovation shops&mdash;transient locations for dreaming and imagining one&rsquo;s future home&mdash;these colour fragments were sampled from personal photographs taken during an emotionally tumultuous time of frustration, joy and melancholy.\r\n\r\nOriginally created as a digital response to an invitation for the 50th anniversary of the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver, BC).\n\n**Description**: Launch Pad provided opportunities for recent xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), sḵwx̱w&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) and Vancouver-based graduates from art and design institutions to enter into the field of public art.
