    "biography": "David Marshall was born in Alberta. He attended the Ontario College of Art as a teen and later the Vancouver School of Art. He was impressed by the work of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. He organized the first outdoor exhibition of sculpture in Canada - an exhibition of BC sculptors that opened in Vancouver July 6, 1956,  and featured the work of 22 artists.  Marshall initiated two subsequent biennial exhibitions and later became a founding member of The Northwest Institute of Sculpture in Eugene, Oregon, resulting in the establishment of a chapter institute in Vancouver.  The Institute sponsored many exhibits of outdoor sculpture.  Marshall was also involved in the formation of the Western Chapter of the Sculptor's Society of Canada in 1970 and later helped form the Sculptor's Society of B.C. During Canada's centennial year (1967), he organized another outdoor sculpture exhibition which took place on the Queen Elizabeth Theatre plaza.  He taught at Capilano College from 1973 to 1990. Marshall works primarily in stone and wood and has exhibited his sculpture since 1950 in Canada and abroad, notably in Mexico at the invitation of Mexican sculptor Sebastian. In 1987 he served as advisor for a private sculpture garden in Bellingham which was later purchased by the City of Bellingham and maintained as a a sculpture park.  In 2001 the City of Bellingham honoured Marshall with a retrospective of his outdoor bronze and marble sculptures.",

Working mainly in sculpture and installation, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing diaspora of Cuba.  Politically and socially charged, Yero\u2019s work contends with issues of national identity and plays with the boundaries of kitsch and high art, frequently comprising small-scale ceramic objects that reference pop art and the tourist souvenir.  Metaphors of death and water are prevalent throughout Yero\u2019s practice. Through large-scale installations, he has explored the effect of the multiple on the bodily experience of the viewer. Most recently he has investigated the effects of light on the eye through his sculptural light installation Passage, which will be presented at Access Gallery as part of the public art project Bright Light, commissioned by the City of Vancouver.\r\n\r\nSolo exhibitions of Yero\u2019s work include: Loop galeria 23 y 12, Havana, Cuba (2008); Hereafter, Xeno Gallery, Dadabase, Vancouver, BC (2003); Landmark, Belkin Satellite Vancouver, BC (2002); Transplant, Grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC (2002). Recent group exhibitions include: F.A.R.Xchange 1: The Desert Between Us, Future Arts Research, Arizona State University, Phoenix AZ (2008); Nuit Blanche Toronto ON (2006); Contemporary Art From Cuba: Irony and Survival on the Utopian Island, a traveling exhibition organized by Arizona State Art Museum, and circulated by Independent Curators International (ICI), New York (2001).",

Whether inspired by Shakespeare and classic parables, the animal kingdom or life itself, the end results are original multi-disciplinary productions that challenge the mind, fuel the imagination and celebrate the human spirit. The company\u2019s roots in the Canadian social movements and theatre experiments of the late 20th century are also evident in its work, as is the influence of 19th century philosophers, cultural theorists and the great physical theatre artists, such as Jacques LeCoq.

    "biography": "Doug Taylor was born in Chilliwack, BC in 1947. Kinetic in nature, his public nstallation sculpture has focused largely on wind, water and solar powered features. Whimsical, folk art inspired elements are often signature to his work. (e.g. Khenko and Wind Swimmer).  Addressing the global challenge of sustainability his current sculptures are  \"generating capital \u201d by selling excess electrical power back to BC Hydro.  These energy systems also feature listening stations which help remind us of sounds that are ever present in the natural world, but often unnoticed (e.g. Seattle Center\u2019s Bird Song Listening Station).  Whimsical, folk art inspired elements are often signature to his work (e.g. Khenko and Wind Swimmer). The challenge is to integrate ecological, historical, social and aesthetic considerations, contextualizing them into the site specific values of place.",

He has worked in sculpture, video, photography and site-specific public installation. Many of his permanent sculptures and temporary installations in India and throughout Asia including exhibitions at Khoj, New Delhi (2008), Hong Kong Art fair (2010) have been constructed with bamboo. Considered a pedestrian material in India because of its abundance, Waqif draws on the multiple ways in which bamboo is used in India, including scaffolding for construction projects, etc.The use of bamboo underscores Waqif\u2019s interest in innovative constructions using traditional, local materials (vernacular architecture) as well as his ongoing concern for environmental sustainability. However following invitations to create site-specific works in Europe, where bamboo is not a common material, Waqif turned his attention to the solid waste management systems in the cities he visited. This led to the use of more unconventional materials such as discarded wood panels, wiring, metal, steal and plastic waste. He has created site-specific installations for the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France (2012), the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial in Brisbane, Australia (2013), among others."

His artistic responses vary, depending on the architectural requirements: when appropriate, his dialogue with the space can be colorful and bold. At other times, he prefers simple compositions, using layers of clear beveled glasses and prisms to create a timeless elegance.",

This is when the Vancouver Morris Men perform WELSH BORDER MORRIS. We wear dark clothes and rags and have our faces \"blacked\" as a form of disguise. The Welsh Border dances are probably the oldest variants of the Morris. Nearly all the dances consist of vigourous stepping and powerful stick clashing accompanied by a loud band comprising melodeon, banjo, fiddle, whistle, drums, triangle, trombone and tuba! See some picutres of us dancing Welsh Border here.\r\nOn Plough Sunday (the first Sunday after 12th night), we perform MOLLY DANCING and assoicated rituals from East Anglia. (Traditionally, these dances and rituals were performed on the first Monday after 12th night, but as most of us are at work on that day - unlike olden times! - we've moved the event one day earlier.) For Molly dancing, the men, dressed in old farmers clothes and with blackened faces, typically carry a plough from door-to-door, performing a strange, stamping dance lead by the \"head\" couple - the King and the Molly (a \"man-woman\"). The photo to the right was taken in 1992 during our inaugural Molly dance-out, an event which has now become a regular, annual event. The dances, which come from the villages of Girton and Comberton near Cambridge, are based on Feast Dances - communal social dances from the 19th century. Also on Plough Sunday, we perform the \"WOOING\" MUMMERS PLAY from Bassingham. Here are some pictures of the VMM \"in action\" on Plough Sunday, January 2003 and Plough Sunday, January 2005.

From 1960 to 1977, he completed more than 100 murals of ceramics, bronze and aluminium throughout the world. In 1977 he completed his most substantial work of approximately 40x80 sq. ft. at the Grand Theatre in Quebec City.  In one corner of the mural he used a line from Quebec poet Claude Peloquin, translated, \"Aren't you fed up with dying, you fools? Enough!\" Members of the public reacted to the use of \"vulgar\" French in the Grand Theatre. Supporters of the artist organized a demonstration 1800 strong that included sculptor Armand Vaillancourt who wore a suit of armor and rode a horse on stage, waving banners and demanding freedom of expression. The architect and the government supported the artist's rights. (Star Weekly, Sept.4, 1971) Bonet also made two aluminium doors encrusted with glass for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the vault \"Our Lady of the Sky\" at the Kennedy Airport in NY. He taught at the School of Architecture, University of Quebec, 1966-1968, and was active in the restoration of the Temple of the Sagrada Familia by Antoni Gaudi in Barcelona. His work showed at Expo 1970 in Osaka in the Quebec Pavillion. He died in Quebec on December 25, 1979, at the age of 47, after a long illness.",

The modernist sensibility of his photography advanced Vancouver's new rational and functionalist ideals of architecture and put Canadian architecture on an international footing. In 1998 the Vancouver Art Gallery had an exhibition entitled, \"The New Spirit: Modern Architecture in Vancouver, 1938-1963\".

    "biography": "Zvonar's collage works are composed of source materials drawn from art history, contemporary advertising and popular culture. They question existing social and cultural systems through the use of humour and irony. Her work often speaks to the ethos and aspirations of those on the periphery of mainstream society, drawing inspiration from counterculture movements that challenge the status quo. Zvonar treats imagery as metaphor, establishing a referential context that calls into question popular conceptions and historical canons to address cultural constructions of power. She often uses a feminist perspective to illustrate how rules of engagement were unbalanced in the past and remain so today. Zvonar has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions throughout Canada and in New York, Australia, Japan and Belgium. In 2008, Zvonar was the inaugural artist at the Malaspina Print Research Residency and was an artist in residence at the Banff Centre for the Arts for the thematic residency Cosmic Ray Research. She received the 2009 City of Vancouver Mayor's Arts Award for Emerging Visual Artist; was presented with the 2011 Emily Award for outstanding achievement by an Emily Carr University alum; and was the 2015 recipient of the Shadbolt Foundation's VIVA Award.",

Marega's first Canadian commission was the bronze bust of Vancouver's second mayor, David Oppenheimer, 1910.  Marega was one of the original teachers in 1925 at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts (now Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design) and was an active member of the British Columbia Art League.  He changed his first name from Carlo to Charles after becoming a Canadian citizen in 1926. The Maregas were thought a handsome couple, she was beautiful and he was finely groomed with a waxed mustache. They made an impressive entrance at events. Marega  did the ornamental work at the Orpheum Theatre and a number of decorated plaster ceilings and walls in private homes in Shaughnessy.  Prior to WWII Marega was commissioned by the Italian Consulate to produce a plaster bust of Benito Mussolini. It was left behind when the Italian Consulate closed during the war and is now in  the Vancouver Archives. Marega was plagued by poverty during the Depression but managed a few more commissions. He died of a heart attack at the art school in 1939 at the age of 68.",

    "biography": "Nationally and internationally acclaimed artist, Joe Fafard, was born to French-Canadian parents in the small agricultural community of Ste. Marthe, Saskatchewan.  He attended the University of Manitoba (BFA 1966) and Pennsylvania State University (MFA 1968). He was at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina from 1968 \u2013 1974 and visiting lecturer at the University of California at Davis in 1980-1981. Joe Fafard is a distinguished full-time artist and sculptor who currently resides on an acreage near Lumsden, Saskatchewan.    \r\n\r\nMr. Fafard is one of Canada\u2019s leading professional visual artists and has exhibitions of a wide variety of work in galleries and museums across the country and around the world, including the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan.  He is widely recognized as being at the forefront of his art, and his outstanding contributions to the arts have significantly raised the profile of both Saskatchewan and Canada on the national stage. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981; awarded the Architectural Institute of Canada Allied Arts Award in 1987; received an honorary Degree from the University of Regina in 1989, and from the University of Manitoba in 2007; received the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002; received the National Prix Montfort in 2003; received the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts in 2005;  was named CTV Citizen of the Year in 2006; and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.  Joe Fafard will also be receiving his 3rd honorary Doctorat degree from the University of Saskatchewan in June of 2012.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the pinnacle of his career was the touring Retrospective exhibition, hosted by 6 different venues, from September 2007 through September 2009, jointly organized by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery in Regina.  However,  most recently, Joe Fafard was chosen to be honored by Canada Post in their \u201cArt Canada\u201d series of postage stamps, released February 23, 2012.  Three of his artworks are featured on the domestic Canadian stamps, the USA stamps and the International stamps.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970\u2019s, much of his sculpture used clay as a medium.  In 1985, he shifted to bronze as his chief sculptural medium, successfully establishing a foundry in Pense.  \r\nHis insight and humor characterize his portraits of neighbors, farm animals, wildlife, and famous artists that he came to respect as he learned his craft.  His work in bronze is displayed across Canada and his \u201ccows\u201d have become one of his trademarks.  Some say that Joe Fafard adds a sense of humor to his depiction of the everyday through his artwork; Joe says that he never really took it out...\r\n\r\nQuote from Joe: \"I can't put a finger on what compels me to make these things, but I keep doing it anyway.  Well, it is a good way to live and make a living.  I'm quite happy about it!\"",

He graduated with a BA in Fine Arts from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a MA in Book Arts from the Camberwell College of Arts at the London Institute, England. In his early works, Tsang combined texts in decorative patterns to create wallpaper that covers the walls, floors, and ceilings of their designated exhibition spaces. On closer inspection, seemingly elegant floral patterns reveal themselves as profane writings by both the artist and other authors. In doing so, Tsang brings to the fore contradictions between image and text, appearance and content. His immersive vinyl text installations have covered the walls and floors of galleries and museums around the world including solo exhibitions at the Centre for ChineseContemporary Art, Manchester (2008); Mori Art Museum, Tokyo (2011\u201312); and M+ Pavilion, Hong Kong (2016). Tsang has participated in group exhibitions including the Lyon Biennial, France (2009\u201310); Memories of the Future, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul (2010\u201311); Sydney Biennial (2010); Asian Art Biennial, Taichung, Taiwan (2011\u201312); Landscape: The Virtual, The Actual, The Possible?, Guangdong Times Museum, Guangzhou, China (2014), and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, SanFrancisco (2014\u201315); Chinese Whispers: Recent Art from the Sigg and M+ Sigg Collections, Kunstmuseum Bern and Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern (2016); and Tales of Our Time, Solomon R.

He hopes to express in form the dynamic balance needed in life, between fun and function, rest and action.  \r\n\r\nOver the past few years, Pierre has been involved with many large scale design projects, with clients ranging from the city of Vancouver and the 2010 Olympics and Paralympics, the city of Toronto and Oakville, to the Peace Bridge Authority of Fort Erie, the Walt Disney Corporation, Princeton University, XM radio for Toyota/Lexus Canada, GreyEagle Casino, Toronto\u2019s Royal Canadian Yacht Club, McMaster University, and Concord CityPlace\u2019s ultra-chic, Panorama Lakeshore Condominium Tower.In addition to his design consultancy work, Pierre also has a successful furniture line, Mitosis, which was featured in the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and Toronto Life magazine, and has also been recently commissioned to become principal furniture for the lobby and lounge areas for Princeton University\u2019s Julian Street Student Library. \r\n\r\nPierre\u2019s background in industrial design and biochemistry, coupled with his creativity, methodology and technical computer expertise, give him a unique approach and process to art and design, while keeping in mind the delicate balance needed between materials, environment, fun and functionality.",

His installation and photographic works have been exhibited internationally and he has participated in residencies in Europe, Asia, Australia and North America. While the majority of his projects are solo efforts, Bomford oten works collaboratively with a number of different partners including his brother Nathan, father Jim and with other artists such as: Verena Kaminiarz, Mark Dudiak and Carl Boutard.

    "biography": "Nicolas Sassoon\u2019s work has long been concerned with the tensions between the pixel and the screen, reflecting on their entanglement and materiality by integrating pixelated figures, moir\u00e9 patterns and early computer graphics into experiential displays. This focus on early computer graphics is driven by the sculptural, material and pictorial qualities of this imagery, as well as its limitations and its poetics. Sassoon's work often explores the projective dimensions of screen-based space, and the many relationships between computer technology and the natural world. His research leads him to engage in cross-disciplinary projects in the fields of architecture, electronic music, textiles, and art. Nicolas Sassoon lives and works in Vancouver BC Canada, on the unceded lands of the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh (Squamish), St\u00f3:l\u014d and S\u0259l\u0313\u00edlw\u0259ta\u0294/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) and x\u02b7m\u0259\u03b8k\u02b7\u0259y\u0313\u0259m (Musqueam) Nations.

    "biography": "Henri Robideau is a photographer and cultural narrator whose practice is grounded in history and animated by the events of our times. His lifelong involvement in photography incorporates more than fifty years of teaching, professional production for many of Canada\u2019s leading artists and personal art creation incorporating photographic imagery and handwritten narrative text.Born 1946 in Bristol, Connecticut, he grew up in New England, North Carolina and California, where his teen years were spent in the booming post WWII suburbs of San Diego county. In university he studied chemistry at San Diego State College for two years but dropped out and moved in 1966 to the Bay Area, pursuing a life in the arts. He trained as a commercial photographer at Laney College in Oakland, before emigrating to Vancouver in 1970 as a refugee from the violence of America and as the fulfillment of a promise to his grandfather to someday return to the land of his ancestors.His first Canadian job as photo-technician for the Vancouver Public Library Historical Photograph Section, provided an immersion into Vancouver\u2019s visual history and introduced him to the work of photographer Mattie Gunterman. In 1976 he left the world of archives and researched Mattie Gunterman\u2019s life, producing an exhibition of her work that toured 26 venues and led to the 1995 publication of her historical biography, Flapjacks &amp; Photographs.In 1980 he launched a decade-long project The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, crisscrossing Canada in search of monumental human activity and the true meaning of Canada. After producing a series of sixty large scale black and white panoramic photographs he moved to Montreal in 1987 to work on the eastern side of the Survey. On July 14, his second day in Montreal, his panoramas were destroyed in a flood. His lost work was later celebrated in the publication Canada\u2019s Gigantic! Four years in Montreal came to an end with attending the events at Oka, followed by a trip to Japan he\u2019d been putting off since he was 9. The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey went largely unfinished after amassing more than 1500 panoramas, but out of it came 500 Fun Years a narrative on Colonialism done for the 1992 500th anniversary of resistance.In 1991 he moved back to Vancouver working for Green Peace photographer Robert Keziere out of Jack Shadbolt\u2019s old studio on Cambie Street providing photographic services and productions for Canada\u2019s leading artists, galleries and publications. He also taught photography at Emily Carr College of Art as a sessional for the next 25 years. For the past thirty years his practice has been in the form of multi panel photographic montages with holographic text.

In these works, Wurm gives written or drawn instructions to participants that indicate actions or poses to perform with everyday objects such as chairs, buckets, fruit, or knit sweaters. These sculptures are by nature temporal and ephemeral, challenging the traditional and formal qualities of the medium. By incorporating actions into the process, and utilizing photography to capture and convey the experiences, the boundaries between art, daily life, spectator and participant break down.While Wurm considers humour an important tool in his work, there is always an underlying social critique of contemporary culture, particularly in response to the Capitalist influences and resulting societal pressures that the artist sees as contrary to our internal ideals.Erwin Wurm, born in Bruck an der Mur/Styria, Austria, lives and works in Vienna and Limberg, Austria. - Vancouver Art Gallery",
