# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do you need location access?

Location access helps us provide you with the best possible experience:

- **Find nearby artworks**: We show you public art in your immediate area
- **Accurate submissions**: When you submit new artwork, we can automatically capture its precise location
- **Improve map experience**: We can center the map on your location for easier navigation
- **Better recommendations**: We can suggest artworks to visit based on your current location

**Privacy note**: Your location is only used locally in your browser to enhance your experience. We do not track or store your location data.

## What types of artwork can I submit?

You can submit any publicly accessible artwork including murals, sculptures, monuments, street art, mosaics, installations, and other forms of public art. The artwork should be visible and accessible to the general public.

## Do I need an account to use Cultural Archiver?

No! You can submit artwork and explore the map without creating an account. However, creating an account allows you to claim your anonymous submissions, sync your data across devices, and helps us prevent spam.

## How do you ensure data quality?

All submissions go through a moderation process where trained moderators verify the information and photos. We also use community reporting to maintain data accuracy and remove inappropriate content.

## Can I edit artwork information?

Currently, artwork information is managed through our moderation system. If you notice incorrect information, you can submit a new entry with the correct details, and our moderators will review and update the record.

## Is the data available for research or other projects?

Yes! We believe in open cultural data. Our database will be available for public download under a Creative Commons license, making it valuable for researchers, city planners, and other cultural initiatives.

## How can I report inappropriate content?

If you encounter inappropriate content, please contact our moderation team. We take content quality seriously and will promptly review and address any reported issues.
