# Take photos of artworks

***Action: Safeguard Creativity***

Public art is temporary by nature — paint chips, murals fade, and sculptures weather with time. The single best way to preserve it is through photographs. By capturing artworks in the present moment, you create a lasting record that might one day be the only memory of its existence. Every photo you contribute adds to a shared cultural archive that future generations can learn from, enjoy, and be inspired by.

Taking photos doesn’t require expensive gear — even a phone camera can make a meaningful difference. Aim for clear, well-lit shots that show the artwork in its entirety, and if possible, capture close-ups of key details, plaques, or artist signatures. By documenting what you see, you become the custodian of creativity, ensuring no mural, sculpture, or installation disappears without a trace.

## How to contribute

1. Find a public artwork near you.
2. Take clear, well-lit photos of the whole piece and any important details.
3. Upload your photos to the archive with the artwork entry.
