# Explore Art Nearby

***Action: Discover Nearby Art***

Artists create for others to witness. When you take the time to visit a mural, sculpture, or installation, you complete the cycle of creation — the artwork comes alive because someone has seen it. By exploring public art near you, you not only enjoy the experience yourself but also honor the artist’s intention and give back to the creative act. Every visit is an affirmation that the work matters.

Exploring art can be a personal adventure or a shared journey. Use the map to guide your path, discover hidden pieces in your neighborhood, or make a day out of visiting works across the city. As you stand in front of each piece, know that your presence is part of its ongoing life. By witnessing public art firsthand, you play a vital role in ensuring it continues to inspire and endure.

## How to contribute

1. Open the map of artworks near you.
2. Visit an artwork in person.
3. Mark it as “visited” to complete the journey.
