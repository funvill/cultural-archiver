# Update information on artworks or artists

***Action: Protect History***

Art doesn’t just live in images — it lives in names, dates, stories, and context. Every detail you add or correct protects the truth of our shared history. Whether it’s fixing a spelling mistake in an artist’s name, noting when a mural was created, or linking to an artist’s website, your contribution strengthens the accuracy of the archive. These details ensure that future seekers know not only what the art looked like, but also who made it and why.

Think of this as detective work in service of memory. Artists deserve to be remembered for their contributions, and artworks deserve to be understood in their proper context. By enriching the archive with accurate and meaningful information, you help safeguard the story behind the art, keeping it alive long after walls are painted over or statues are moved.

How to contribute:

Open the page for an artwork or artist.

Review the details and check for accuracy.

Add missing information or update incorrect entries.
