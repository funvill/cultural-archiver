# Why I Started Public Art Registry

I created Public Art Registry to solve two questions that often frustrated me: ***What am I looking at? and What art is nearby?***

While traveling, I’d stumble across striking murals or sculptures, but too often there was no plaque, no sign, and no way to find out who created the work or why. Even in my own city, I’d wonder what art might be around the corner, but without a reliable map, it was pure chance whether I found anything.

The moment that pushed me to act came in 2025, when the Vancouver Mural Festival took down their website. In an instant, ten years of mural history and artist write-ups disappeared. That knowledge, those stories, and that history — gone. It was a loss for the commons, and I knew something needed to be done.

Public art is worth preserving because it tells us who we are at a moment in time. If we don’t document it, human creativity disappears without a trace. We can’t learn, grow, or build on our culture if we forget it. I wanted to create something that would give back to the commons — a cultural resource that belongs to everyone, not just one company or institution.

As I began cataloging art in my own city, I realized something astonishing. I knew Vancouver had public art, but I underestimated the scale — I thought there might be 300 works, maybe 400 at most. Instead, I found thousands, scattered across neighborhoods, hidden in alleys, tucked into parks. Now that I’ve trained myself to look for art, I see it everywhere, on every street. And I want others to see it too.

That’s what Public Art Registry is: not just a database, but a lens for seeing the world differently. A way to recognize the creativity that surrounds us every day. And when people participate — when they take a photo, correct an artist’s name, or visit a work in person — it means this vision is working. It means they’re giving back to the commons and helping make the world a better place.

I see myself less as an archivist and more as a builder of tools. My role is to create a platform where others can do the meaningful work of preserving, honoring, and sharing art. Ultimately, I want the community to carry this project forward, long after I’m gone. A strong archive is built by many hands, not one.

My hope is that fifty years from now, someone will look at Public Art Registry and see a history of culture through the ages: millions of artworks and artists who gave the world a piece of their creative selves. I want this archive to be a source of inspiration for new art, a resource for researchers, and a living proof that when people come together to honor creativity, we all benefit.

Public art is fragile. But together, we can make sure its legacy endures.
