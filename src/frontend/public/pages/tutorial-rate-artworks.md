# Highlight Great Works (Coming soon)

***Action: Share What Moves You***

Art lives through connection, and what moves you can spark inspiration in others. By highlighting the works that resonate most with you, you guide future explorers toward what matters and help elevate the pieces that deserve to be remembered. Your judgment is more than a rating — it’s a reflection of your own encounter with art and a gift to those who come after you.

When ranking becomes available, you’ll have the chance to shape the cultural memory of public art. By sharing what inspires you, you amplify the voice of the artist and strengthen the bond between art and community. Every choice you make helps others discover works that might move them in the same way, carrying forward the spirit of creativity through shared appreciation.

## How to contribute (coming soon)

1. Visit the artwork’s page.
2. Reflect on how it makes you feel.
3. Rank it to guide others toward inspiration.
