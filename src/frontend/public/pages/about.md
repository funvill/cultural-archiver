# About Public Art Registry

Public art is fragile. Murals fade, sculptures crumble, websites disappear, and with them the stories of the artists who created them. Without documentation, that history vanishes forever.

**Public Art Registry exists to ensure that doesn’t happen.** Our mission is simple: to document public artworks for future generations. We believe art is part of our shared cultural memory, and when it disappears without record, the world loses something irreplaceable.

This project is a **community archive** built by everyone, for everyone. Contributors help by photographing artworks, updating artist information, and recording what they discover. Every action - a photo, a note, a correction - keeps creativity alive and accessible for future researchers, artists, and curious wanderers.

The philosophy behind Public Art Registry is rooted in **the commons**: the idea that cultural knowledge should be shared freely for the benefit of all. Too much of the world is built on taking from the commons and privatizing it. We believe in the opposite - giving back. Like Wikipedia, this project is meant to add to the common good, creating value that can’t be measured in profit but can be felt across generations.

That’s why all contributions here are **shared under open licensing** ([Creative commons zero](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)), so that other platforms like Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap can reuse the data. The artworks and their stories don’t “belong” to us - they belong to the world. Our job is to safeguard them and make them accessible to everyone.

The tools on this site are designed to make participation engaging and rewarding. You can explore nearby works, mark what you’ve seen, highlight the pieces that inspire you, and help keep records accurate. Whether you’re discovering art in your neighborhood or traveling abroad, you can play a vital role in **protecting culture from being forgotten**.

Our long-term vision is ambitious: we hope Public Art Registry becomes the default place people turn to when they ask the same questions that sparked this project - What am I looking at? Where can I find more art? Beyond that, we want this archive to serve researchers, archivists, artists, and everyday people who simply love art and don’t want to see it lost to time.

Together, we can ensure that public art remains visible, celebrated, and meaningful - not just today, but **for generations to come**.
