  "about": "---\r\ntitle: About\r\ndate: 2025-10-03\r\ncategory: About\r\n---\r\n\r\n# About Public Art Registry\r\n\r\nPublic art is fragile. Murals fade, sculptures crumble, websites disappear, and with them the stories of the artists who created them. Without documentation, that history vanishes forever.\r\n\r\n**Public Art Registry exists to ensure that doesn’t happen.** Our mission is simple: to document public artworks for future generations. We believe art is part of our shared cultural memory, and when it disappears without record, the world loses something irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nThis project is a **community archive** built by everyone, for everyone. Contributors help by photographing artworks, updating artist information, and recording what they discover. Every action - a photo, a note, a correction - keeps creativity alive and accessible for future researchers, artists, and curious wanderers.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy behind Public Art Registry is rooted in **the commons**: the idea that cultural knowledge should be shared freely for the benefit of all. Too much of the world is built on taking from the commons and privatizing it. We believe in the opposite - giving back. Like Wikipedia, this project is meant to add to the common good, creating value that can’t be measured in profit but can be felt across generations.\r\n\r\nThat’s why all contributions here are **shared under open licensing** ([Creative commons zero](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)), so that other platforms like Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap can reuse the data. The artworks and their stories don’t “belong” to us - they belong to the world. Our job is to safeguard them and make them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe tools on this site are designed to make participation engaging and rewarding. You can explore nearby works, mark what you’ve seen, highlight the pieces that inspire you, and help keep records accurate. Whether you’re discovering art in your neighborhood or traveling abroad, you can play a vital role in **protecting culture from being forgotten**.\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is ambitious: we hope Public Art Registry becomes the default place people turn to when they ask the same questions that sparked this project - What am I looking at? Where can I find more art? Beyond that, we want this archive to serve researchers, archivists, artists, and everyday people who simply love art and don’t want to see it lost to time.\r\n\r\nTogether, we can ensure that public art remains visible, celebrated, and meaningful - not just today, but **for generations to come**.\r\n",
  "blog-why-i-started-public-art-registry": "---\r\ntitle: Why I Started Public Art Registry\r\ndate: 2025-10-03\r\ncategory: Blog\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Why I Started Public Art Registry\r\n\r\nI created Public Art Registry to solve two questions that often frustrated me: ***What am I looking at? and What art is nearby?***\r\n\r\nWhile traveling, I’d stumble across striking murals or sculptures, but too often there was no plaque, no sign, and no way to find out who created the work or why. Even in my own city, I’d wonder what art might be around the corner, but without a reliable map, it was pure chance whether I found anything.\r\n\r\nThe moment that pushed me to act came in 2025, when the Vancouver Mural Festival took down their website. In an instant, ten years of mural history and artist write-ups disappeared. That knowledge, those stories, and that history — gone. It was a loss for the commons, and I knew something needed to be done.\r\n\r\nPublic art is worth preserving because it tells us who we are at a moment in time. If we don’t document it, human creativity disappears without a trace. We can’t learn, grow, or build on our culture if we forget it. I wanted to create something that would give back to the commons — a cultural resource that belongs to everyone, not just one company or institution.\r\n\r\nAs I began cataloging art in my own city, I realized something astonishing. I knew Vancouver had public art, but I underestimated the scale — I thought there might be 300 works, maybe 400 at most. Instead, I found thousands, scattered across neighborhoods, hidden in alleys, tucked into parks. Now that I’ve trained myself to look for art, I see it everywhere, on every street. And I want others to see it too.\r\n\r\nThat’s what Public Art Registry is: not just a database, but a lens for seeing the world differently. A way to recognize the creativity that surrounds us every day. And when people participate — when they take a photo, correct an artist’s name, or visit a work in person — it means this vision is working. It means they’re giving back to the commons and helping make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nI see myself less as an archivist and more as a builder of tools. My role is to create a platform where others can do the meaningful work of preserving, honoring, and sharing art. Ultimately, I want the community to carry this project forward, long after I’m gone. A strong archive is built by many hands, not one.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that fifty years from now, someone will look at Public Art Registry and see a history of culture through the ages: millions of artworks and artists who gave the world a piece of their creative selves. I want this archive to be a source of inspiration for new art, a resource for researchers, and a living proof that when people come together to honor creativity, we all benefit.\r\n\r\nPublic art is fragile. But together, we can make sure its legacy endures.\r\n\r\n**— Steven Smethurst, Founder**\r\n",
