# Archived Custom Migration System

This directory contains the custom migration system files that were replaced with Cloudflare's native D1 migration system on 2025-01-08.

## Archived Files

### migrate.ts
- **Purpose**: Custom migration runner that manually spawned wrangler CLI processes
- **Archived Because**: 
  - Lacked migration state tracking, causing `SQLITE_AUTH` errors from re-running completed migrations
  - Had poor error handling and environment confusion
  - Didn't support D1 compatibility validation
  - Manually reinvented functionality that Wrangler already provides natively

### mock-schema.sql
- **Purpose**: Mock schema file for testing migration system
- **Archived Because**: No longer needed with Wrangler's native migration testing capabilities

### test-schema.sql
- **Purpose**: Test schema file for migration validation
- **Archived Because**: Replaced by new D1-compatible validation system

## Problems Addressed by Migration

The custom migration system had several critical issues:

1. **No Migration State Tracking**: The system tried to run ALL migrations every time, causing conflicts when migrations had already been applied
2. **D1 Compatibility Issues**: Migrations failed with `SQLITE_AUTH` errors due to unsupported SQLite features:
   - `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` statements
   - `WITHOUT ROWID` table modifiers  
   - Complex `CHECK` constraints using functions like `length()`
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Failed migrations didn't provide actionable error messages or recovery paths
4. **Environment Confusion**: No clear separation between development and production database operations
5. **Manual Dependency on Wrangler**: Custom spawning of wrangler CLI processes was error-prone and inconsistent

## Replacement System

The new Wrangler-native migration system provides:

- **Built-in State Tracking**: Wrangler automatically tracks applied migrations per environment
- **D1 Compatibility Validation**: Automated checks for D1-incompatible SQL patterns
- **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between development and production workflows
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Native support for reverting problematic migrations
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages with actionable recovery paths

## Migration Guide

If you need to understand the old system for historical purposes:

1. The `migrate.ts` file contains the full custom migration logic
2. It used environment variables: `D1_DATABASE_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
3. It spawned `wrangler d1 execute` commands manually
4. Migration files were processed sequentially with basic regex filtering

The new system uses standard `wrangler d1 migrations` commands with proper state management and validation.
