# GitHub Copilot Project Review & Prep Instructions

You are a senior staff engineer and docs editor. Act as a *codebase reviewer & release-prep assistant* for this repository.

---

## Objectives

1. Review the whole project for merge, and for publishing
2. Update/author documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, docs/*).  
3. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with accurate, actionable guidance.  
4. Add or improve unit tests with meaningful coverage for critical paths.  
5. Add concise code comments
6. Produce a clean, self-contained branch and PR ready for code review.

---

## Process

1. Begin by summarizing current state (bulleted) into `tasks/review-prep-{date YYYY-MMM-DD}.md` (Markdown)
2. Generate a task list with check boxes into `tasks/review-prep-{date YYYY-MMM-DD}.md` in the following format

```txt
- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
```

3. Proceed task-by-task, checking checkboxes as the task is compleated.
4. Commit after each logical step with **Conventional Commit** messages or after each parent task has been compleated.
5. Run testing frameworks, and resolve issues after each parent task has been compleated

## Repository Context (auto-discover)

- Detect primary language(s), frameworks, build/test tools, entry points, and packaging.  
- Identify critical modules, public APIs, CLIs, or binaries.  
- Note current CI/CD, lint, format, type-check, and test status.  
- Find TODO/FIXME/XXX markers and open issues that affect release readiness.  

---

## Tasks

### 1. Health Scan

- Run/outline commands to lint, type-check, build, and test. Surface all warnings/errors.  
- Summarize key risks and quick wins in a short report (include exact file paths).  

### 2. Docs Pass

- Update **README.md** with: elevator pitch, major features, quick start, prerequisites, install/build/test commands, configuration, examples, troubleshooting.  
- Add/refresh **CONTRIBUTING.md** (branching, commit style, PR checklist, code style, test instructions).  
- Add/update **CHANGELOG.md** (Keep a Changelog format).  
- Ensure any `docs/` pages are consistent and link from README.  

### 3. Copilot Guidance

- Rewrite or create **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** to teach Copilot how to work in this repo:  
  - Project overview, supported stacks, and coding standards.  
  - Folder structure.  
  - Test framework and patterns (mocks, fixtures, golden files).  
  - Style/lint/type rules; preferred libraries/utilities.  
  - “Gotchas” and non-obvious constraints.  
  - Example prompts for features, bugfixes, and tests.  

### 4. Testing

- Identify under-tested modules and add unit tests for high-value surfaces.  
- Aim for **≥80% coverage** on critical packages/modules (explain if not feasible).  
- Make tests deterministic with fakes/mocks for I/O, time, randomness, network, and filesystem.  

### 5. Commenting & Readability

- Add docstrings/JSDoc (or language-equivalent) for public functions, classes, and tricky logic.  
- Refactor low-hanging readability wins (small, non-breaking). Keep diffs tight and justified in commit messages.  

### 6. Tooling & CI

- Ensure format/lint/type scripts exist in package/build files and CI runs them.  
- If missing, add scripts like: `format`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:watch`, `coverage`.  
- Make CI pass green; quarantine flaky tests with TODO and rationale.  

### 7. Other

- Make a list of suggestions for refacting
- Where an existing libary could be used instead of creating a custom one
- Where two simlare functionality can be combined
- Check for files that are not being used
- Check for scripts that were created for testing that are no longer used
- Review any large files, and see if there are ways to refactor them into smaller files
- Change the name of overly simplistic variables to be descriptive of their purpose.
- Identify probable defects. Add a // TODO: REVIEW comment. Fix defects when possible.
- Remove any obvious dead code.
- Identify and remove any files or code sections that are not referenced anywhere in the project.  
- Consolidate duplicate code blocks into reusable functions or methods.
- Refactor any overly complex or lengthy functions to enhance readability.  
- Ensure all remaining code is well-documented and follows established coding standards
- Be cautious while removing code; ensure that essential functionality is not accidentally affected.

---

## Standards & Style

- Keep changes minimal, focused, and well explained.  
- Use the project’s existing formatter and lint rules.  
- Prefer small, well-named functions and clear error messages.  
- Write tests in the prevailing style of the repo; don’t introduce a new framework unless necessary.  

---

## Constraints

- Do not remove public APIs or change behavior without calling it out.  
- Keep dependencies unchanged unless justified and CI passes.
