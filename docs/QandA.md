# Sessions

## Session 1 - Visionary-style deep dive

Visionary-style deep dive. I’ll ask a series of numbered, big-picture questions to sharpen the concept of your art-recognition / gamified discovery platform. You can answer in short notes or brainstorm freely, and I’ll fold your answers into the vision doc.

### 1. What’s the primary goal of this app: education, exploration, archiving, or gamified play?

> 1. Exploration. Finding new art and discovering new art projects.

### 2. Do you see it more as a tool for personal discovery (like a travel companion) or a community-driven archive (Wikipedia for art)?

> 2. A tool for personal discovery

### 3. Should the app focus mainly on public/street art (murals, sculptures, installations) or also cover indoor/museum art?

> 3. public/street art

### 4. How do you want to handle temporary/ephemeral works (festival installations, chalk art, performances)? Should they stay in the archive after they disappear?

> 4. They should fade in the archive, They should still exist as they part of the culture of the city, but for most people this isn't the primary goal of this project.

### 5. How important is automatic recognition (camera → instant ID) vs. community/manual input?

> 5. Nice to have feature. The computer vision is a nice to have but most artworks that are geolocated it should be enugh to know what art work it is.

### 6. If the system can’t identify an artwork, should it offer top guesses (like Seek) or simply let users tag and upload info?

> 6. offer top guesses, if they still can't find it, then offer the ability to add a new artwork

### 7. Would you want partnerships with museums, cities, or art councils to seed the database, or rely mainly on user-generated input?

> 7. Rely mainly on user generated input. But when the project is starting we will be seeding with as much open data information as possible

### 8. What kind of badges/challenges excite you most: location-based hunts, style/genre collections, streaks, or time-limited events?

> 8. Streaks, location based, and style,

### 9. Should there be a competitive element (leaderboards, teams) or keep it more personal and exploratory?

> 9. friendly competiviite

### 10. Would you want users to trade/share finds with friends (like Pokémon cards) or keep collections private?

> 10. Can't trade, just personal lists, the list can be public if the user decides to

### 11. Should users be able to upload corrections or new info about artworks/artists (like Wikipedia)?

> 11. Yes. 100%, primary goal

### 12. Do you want a system of moderation/reputation to validate contributions, or keep it open-ended?

> 12. Everything should be human moderated moderation/reputation

### 13. Should artists themselves be able to claim their works and manage their profiles?

> 13. Yes

### 14. Do you want this to become a serious archive of public art (like a cultural record) or stay as a playful discovery tool?

> 14. playful discovery tool, that tricks people into making a serious archive of public art

### 15. If it’s archival, how will you handle versioning (e.g., murals being painted over, sculptures being moved)?

> 15. linked artworks. Version from 2015 vs 2025 version

### 16. How do you imagine sustaining this long term? (e.g., grants, city partnerships, freemium features, museum licensing, art tourism tie-ins).

> 16. Grants, but keeping the costs low would be helpful.

### 17. Would you want to avoid advertising, or could ads/sponsored hunts be part of the ecosystem?

> 17. Avoid advertising at the start, be useful to the user at the start

### 18. Do you picture this as mobile-first web app, or should it eventually be native iOS/Android for smoother camera use?

> 18. mobile-first web app... If an app is required in the future it can be created, but lets start with a website.

### 19. Should there be an offline mode for museums/festivals with bad signal?

> 19. Nice to have, not a requirement

### 20. How important is social sharing (Instagram-style posts, TikTok-style clips) to the experience?

> 20. Low

### 21. Could you see AR being part of the roadmap (e.g., labels hovering over artworks)?

> 21. Nope

### 22. Should the system support non-visual art (music, performance, digital art), or stay strictly to visual artworks?

> 22. Nice to have, not a requirement

### 23. What would success look like in 5 years? (e.g., a global archive, 1M users, official partnerships, the go-to app for discovering art).

> 23. Global archive with 1M artworks.

---

## Session 2 - big-picture brainstorming mode

Let’s go into big-picture brainstorming mode

### 1. Framing the Project

Is this primarily a game (fun, streaks, badges)? Or an archive (serious, preservation, research)? Or do we explicitly embrace the tension of both: “A game that builds an archive.”

> 1. I like that phrase, "a game that builds an archive". Mention this in the write up. It should be fun to start, but produce a body of data that will help society as a whole. Add to the creative Commons.

### 2. Positioning

Is this the Shazam for art? Or the Pokémon Go for art? Or the Wikipedia for street art? Or all three?

> 2. Pokémon go for art as a first. Then Shazam for art. Then Wikipedia for art as last. It should feel like people are getting tricked into helping build the archive rather than it being its primary purpose. It's more for people hunting for art. And making that a game.

### 3. Community Dynamics

Should the community feel like Wikipedia contributors (serious, fact-checkers)? Or like Pokémon players (collectors, explorers, bragging rights)? Or a hybrid: explorers casually add data, while moderators/curators validate? 👉 Suggestion: Allow layers of participation. Casual players just snap & collect, enthusiasts contribute info, and curators moderate.

> 3. Collectors and explorers finding new relics. And art exhibits for bragging rights. Should be the primary goal. Adding notes and information to the artworks should be secondary. We expect there's to be some false information from the users. We don't want to put any roadblocks for them to add any information, but we should treat all information from users as suspect.

### 4. Geography and Launch

Do we go global from day one (seeded with open datasets)? Or do we pilot in one city (e.g., Vancouver, New York, Lisbon) with strong mural scenes? Or do we launch in festivals (Burning Man, Nuit Blanche, local art fests) where temporary works create urgency? 👉 Suggestion: A city + festival dual pilot: one urban testbed + one temporary event. This stress-tests both permanence and ephemerality.

> 4. Focus in on Vancouver. But see the whole database with open data. So the database looks like it's rich and ready to go. But we only try to focus on Vancouver. If other districts decide to build upon this app with their own things, they should be no impediment meant to it, but we shouldn't focus on it..

### 5. Artist Engagement

Should artists be able to claim their work? Should they get analytics (how many people discovered it)? Should they be able to add context (artist statement, progress photos, related works)? Do we let artists gamify themselves (e.g., “find all my murals around town”)? 👉 Suggestion: Artists should be first-class citizens in the platform. Their buy-in means free marketing and richer data.

> 5. Artist should be first class citizens. They can claim the artwork and show proof that this artwork's theirs. Then they can claim that page and modify it in any way that makes their lives better. We want to provide tools to the artists so they add value to the site. Add verified value and information. Finding a good way to make sure that the artists are who they say they are. Will be important

### 6. Gamification Ideas

Streaks → daily or weekly discovery Collections → e.g., “Find all mosaics in this district” Challenges → monthly themes (“Women artists,” “Eco murals”) Seasonal hunts → during festivals or city events Leaderboards → global or local (city-specific) 👉 Question: How competitive vs. collaborative do you want this to feel?

> 6. Seasonal hunts and collaborative goals. Find 10 of x style artworks. All the challenge goals should be as simple as possible to implement. We should make the database in a way that allows that to to be easy to add. But the challenges should be quite simple. Collect x of of one style or another. Collect x of what's in a city, for example. The challenges should be auto generated. A new one each week. The Monday of every week.

### 7. Archival Depth

Should we track multiple versions of an artwork (before/after restoration, repainting, fading)? Should the archive include artist interviews, QR-linked videos, behind-the-scenes photos? Should we integrate city open data (permits, public art registries) to backstop the archive? 👉 Suggestion: Build an archive with timelines: users could slide to see “Mural in 2015 → 2025 repaint.”

> 7. Archive should be pretty shallow. Allow for text areas and Fields edits. We can expand on this feature later on, but for the beginning we want to have the ability to add a bunch of information but not too much. Too much depth. Having a history of an artwork is nice to have not a requirement. Same thing with versions of an artwork. Or a mural that was here in the '90s has been replaced in the 2010s and then replaced again in the 2020s. These are all good notes.

### 8. Long-Term Vision

Imagine in 5 years: 1M+ artworks documented Partnerships with major art festivals and cities Schools using it for cultural walks Researchers mining it for urban studies 👉 Question: Do you see this as nonprofit-leaning (grant-funded) or startup-leaning (scalable app)? Or a hybrid?

> 8. Non-Profit. We're providing tools to existing galleries and artworks to allow them to be seen by more people and discovered by more people. It'd be great if this had a board and had a onboarding document for galleries and festivals to make this easy for them. Maybe make it so that we can provide services where we set the whole system up for their festival or their city or bia. The focus is on making the world a better place.

### 9. Risks to Consider

Data quality: vandalism, false info, spam. Copyright/licensing: photos of copyrighted art, especially contemporary. Moderation workload: scaling human curation. User fatigue: gamification must stay fresh. 👉 Suggestion: Bake in community governance (like OSM or Wikipedia) rather than central bottlenecks.

> 9. I expect vandalism from day one. All data is suspect that is user submitted. Maybe we should put a trust score on each piece of information that's submitted. Add a million pieces of information or artworks. It's easy enough to do human curated data. But later on we want to have Heroes of different sectors or types of art or locations. They can have teams and we can have team tools to help them quickly. Moderate. Or can we could do like stack overflow where we put the same piece of moderation in front of five or six people and if they all agree we allow that piece of information to go through. But we should expect vandalism and false information from day one.

### 10. Wild Ideas (Future)

AR mode: point camera, see info overlayed live. Time machine: compare how an artwork changed over years. Art journeys: curated walks (“Street art of East Van”) guided by GPS. NFT integration: artists could mint digital twins of murals. AI storytelling: auto-generate playful narratives about each artwork. ✨ So, here are some clarifying questions to move forward: Which metaphor do you want to lean into most: Shazam, Pokémon Go, or Wikipedia? Should this launch globally (with seed data) or city-first (local pilot)? How competitive should the game feel — lighthearted fun or hardcore leaderboard? Do you want artists to be power users with tools, or keep it simple for explorers first? Long-term, do you picture this as nonprofit (grant-supported) or startup (growth-focused)?

## Session 3 - Follow-up Questions

### 1. Tone & Voice: Should the app’s voice feel more like a playful game (“Catch murals like Pokémon!”) or a serious explorer’s log (“Document the city’s art heritage”)?

> 1. Playful, but your the hero helping society by playing this game. For the good of all. Emphasis that that playing helps the world.

### 2. Artists: Do you imagine artists could message players (e.g., leave notes on their artwork page) or should their role be limited to content curation?

> 2. No, artist can contribute and curate their own artists page, but they don't have much other control beyond their own pages

### 3. Moderation: Would you prefer volunteer heroes (community-based like Wikipedia) or paid moderators (small, lean team) to start?

> 3. Volunteers with deep knowledge of specific subjects. Vancouver, murals, mosaic, etc...

### 4. Festivals: Do you want to prioritize them as partners from Day One (so you launch with a festival pilot), or keep that as a “Phase 2” growth strategy?

> 4. Phrase two or later. But keep them in mind while designing the project. Temporary Art installation

### 5. Archival Depth: Should we allow user-contributed photos over time to show how an artwork ages (like time-lapse history), or keep one canonical photo per artwork in MVP?

> 5. Yes, photos over time.

## Session 4 - User Types & Story Exploration

Great — you’re really crystallizing this into a playful mission-driven game. Since you want me to focus now on user types and their stories, I’ll spin up a set of probing questions to tease out different personas and their journeys through the app. This will help us later define audiences, motivations, and feature priorities.

### 1. Everyday Explorer

Who is the casual user? Are they a tourist, a local walker, someone who already likes murals? How often do you expect them to use the app — daily, weekly, occasionally when traveling? What’s their reward loop? Do they want badges, streaks, completion checklists, or just knowledge? How much do they care about contributing data vs. just playing?

> 1. They play part time. On their walk if they happen to see some Art they will load the app. They don't go out of their way to find Art, and don't make list. They don't contribute data. They are useful to know if the Art still exists but about it. They get value out of the app by learning about the Art that they happen upon. Use the app 4-10 Times a month. Not valuable to the app. Do not put effort into capturing these users. Not a priority.

### 2. The Collector / Gamer

Is there a persona who is completionist-driven (wants 100% of artworks in their city)? Should there be leaderboards or public bragging rights for this type of player? What keeps them coming back once they’ve “collected everything nearby”? Seasonal resets, new challenges, or expansions to other cities?

> 2. This are the obsessive player's that we want to find. We want the reward loops to be well defined for this user. They care about being first or top of the list. They want 100% in all areas. We should show them the top stat that they are in on their profile. Reward them highly for discovery of new Art or adding new information. Once they are done their local city they will travel to other cities to add to their reputation. Best case user, we want to provide tools and experience to these users.

### 3. The Artist

When an artist claims their work, what do they most want? Recognition? Analytics (how many people saw their art)? Ability to add their own narrative, bio, or links to other works? Should artists be able to upload progress shots (e.g., mural being painted)? Would you want to give them tools to organize hunts around their own work (“collect all 7 murals I’ve painted in Vancouver”)?

> 3. The artists want to curate the experience that users have with the art that make. Add bio, add in progress photos. Links to more information, videos, etc.. maybe even blogs posts and Maker logs. We provide them with public stats, but that is not a priority. Changes to their Art works details are treated as more trustworthy then random users. No they can't use the site to create hunts around their own work. They can do that externally to the application. These users are nice to have, and can add limited value by adding information to their own work. In MVP don't focus on them.

### 4. The Researcher / Historian

Do you see teachers, researchers, or historians using this app? Should they have special tools (export datasets, access metadata, timelines)? Or is that out of scope until later?

> 4. I would like to have these users, but there aren't many of them. The good ones will want to be paid for their efforts and we can't afford them. Instead this group we should trade inkind services with. They get some special abilities if they contribute to the site. Find some way of detecting theses people and rewarding them. In MVP don't spend too much effort on them.

### 5. The Moderator / Hero

What motivates volunteer moderators? Recognition (titles, hero badges, leaderboards)? A love for accuracy and helping others? Should moderators have visible roles (e.g., “Hero of Vancouver Murals”), or remain behind the scenes? Do they mainly approve contributions, or can they also curate challenges?

> 5. These people are in it for the love of Art. They want to contribute because we make it low effort. They get a sense of 'giving back'. We need to reward these people. Hero badges, perks, etc... I suspect that this group will be mostly interested in a specific groups of artworks. By location or style or specific artist, etc...

### 6. Festival-Goer (Phase 2)

Imagine someone at a temporary art festival: Do they want a special hunt just for the event? Would they expect timed challenges (find 5 pieces before midnight)? Do they keep those artworks in their permanent collection after the festival ends, even if the art disappears?

> 6. Low priority. Prove that they were there at that time and place. Want to know more about the artwork or artists. These people want to share their experiences with others, vanity focused.

### 7. Social Sharer

Should users be able to share their collections with friends? Do you imagine this being more like a personal profile page (subtle, exploratory) or social-media-style feed (more public, dynamic)? Is competition between friends (e.g., “you’ve found 12, I’ve found 20”) a key motivator, or do you want to avoid that tone?

> 7. The profile page should be more of a timeline. Showing their accuplishment.

### 8. The Contributor

How do we motivate people to add missing artworks? Should contributors get special credit (“discovered by [username]”)? Do you imagine levels (Explorer → Contributor → Curator → Hero)?

> 8. Get special credit. This should be a pathway to becoming a volunteer. Adding new artwork should be simple. Should be one of the first services we add at the start as the system will be missing a lot of data at the start and most artwork will need to be added.

### Questions for You

#### 1. Who do you see as the primary hero of the story: the explorer/collector or the artist?

> collector

#### 2. Do you want researchers/educators to be an audience from day one, or only once the archive is mature?

> Afterwards

#### 3. Should artists be given analytics dashboards (views, scans, check-ins), or keep it lightweight?

> Lightweight, only public data that everyone gets access to.

#### 4. How visible should moderators be — public-facing heroes, or quiet background curators?

> Quite background,

#### 5. Should every user type (explorer, artist, moderator, contributor) have separate “paths” inside the app, or do we keep one interface for all?

> Collector path, moderator path, artist path.

## Session 5 - Next Layer of Questions (User Journeys)

To make these archetypes really actionable, I’d like to explore their journeys through the app:

### 1. Collector’s Loop

What’s the daily loop for a collector? Do they wake up and check new challenges? Or do they just check the app whenever they walk into a new neighborhood?

Should collectors have alerts when new artworks are added nearby?

> 1. They check daily, when ever they go into a new area they will check to see if there is art to collect. Alerts for new art. Not in first version. Low priority.

### 2. First Discovery Credit

How visible should the “first discoverer” credit be? On the artwork’s page? On their profile? On leaderboards?

Should collectors compete for “territory” (owning first discoveries in their area), or is it just a badge?

> 2. All three. The artwork should have a badge for first discovery with the name of the person. The finder profile should have a stat about how many artworks they discovered. There should be a stat for "keeping a artwork alive". If a artwork ages out (if a artwork hasn't been visited in more then a year it's marked old possible missing) Just the badge at this point. We can expand this system in the future.

### 3. Contributors

When someone adds a new artwork, do you want them to fill in just the basics (title + photo + location), or should they be encouraged to add as much as possible?

Should the app immediately reward them with something (e.g., “+50 XP for new discovery”)?

> 3. Encourage to add as much information as possible. But everything is optional. No roadblocks in just submitting a photo and location. We can add more rewards later on. At the start just add stats to their profile.

### 4. Moderators

Should moderation be invisible (quiet trust scores, invisible edits), or transparent (public badges like “Hero of Vancouver Murals”)?

How do moderators interact with collectors? Are they in competition, or complementary roles?

> 4. Transparent in MVP. The moderators are only used at the beginning of the game. Later on we hope to use crowd sourcing to do the majority of the moderation. The moderator only check the content submitted for obvious abuse. They don't have to check for truthfulness. Unless they happen to know the answer.

### 5. Profile / Timeline

Do you want profiles to feel like personal trophies (badges, stats, maps of finds), or more like journals (notes, reflections, photos of discoveries)?

Should profiles be public by default or private unless toggled?

> 5. Profiles should be private by default. A journal of events and achievements. At the top of the profile is stats about that user.

## Session 5 - Core Gameplay Features

1. A map of existing known about artworks. The existing artworks come from imported initial seed or by users adding artworks.

2. User can submit a photo of an artwork. They can add it to an existing artworks or create a New artwork. Location and a photo is required. They can add more information if they know any (title, creator, style, medium, etc...)

3. Main page is a map with pins of existing artworks. The pins can be clicked to show a artwork card, the user can continue to the artwork details page. At the bottom of the page is a camera button that a user can click to add a new photo to an existing or new artwork.

4. Artwork details page Information on a specific artwork. The Artworks may only have a photo and a location. Users can add more information like creator name, description, type, style, creation date, installation date, etc .. users can add any Fields, or update the description, or add a person note/reviews. Tags of keywords associated with this artwork. badges

5. Artist profile page. Lists the artworks that are attributed to this creator. Shows a list of artwork cards. Ect. Badges

6. User profile Shows a journal of events, shows stats, etc... badges

7. Photo CV identification. When someone uploads a photo. The system will try and identify it. This helps users contribute the photo to the right artwork.

8. Challenge and badge system. Give rewards to users when they contribute. Leader boards and gamification.

9. Moderation. Expect people to submit abusive content. Moderators review the submitted data for obvious abuse.

10. The map should be able to show the artwork that they have already seen and the Artworks that they have not seen yet. This allows them to have a easy todo list when they are trying to see everything.

11. Search. Search by keywords, by Fields, creator, within a certain location. allows for complex search. These searches can become todo lists later on.

12. All data is submitted with creative Commons Zero license. With the exception that it will be made available to the commons

### MVP is

- Map of artwork, showing pins of existing artworks.
- Artwork card for Pins for map
- An Artwork details page very simple
- An Artwork Submission page, via photo and location, spend most of the time on this feature
- A user profile page
- Authentication/identity (to make profiles + moderation possible).
- Flagging moderation (to deal with vandalism).
- Basic search/filter (otherwise the archive quickly becomes unusable).
- Upload = CC0 agreement (legal + philosophical backbone)

## Session 6 - Login and accounts

Based on the instructions and the feature description you've provided, I need to ask some clarifying questions to create a comprehensive PRD for the authentication system. Let me ask these questions to better understand the requirements:
