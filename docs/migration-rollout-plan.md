- [ ] All migrations validate: `npm run migrate:validate`

### Production Environment
- [ ] Production database backup completed
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for database errors
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Team lead approval for rollout window

## Training Materials

### Quick Reference Card
```bash
# New Migration Commands
npm run migrate:create "migration_name"    # Create new migration
npm run migrate:validate                   # Validate migrations
npm run migrate:dev                        # Apply to development
npm run migrate:prod                       # Apply to production (with safety checks)
npm run migrate:status                     # Check migration status
npm run backup                             # Full backup with migration state
```

### Common Workflows

#### Creating a New Migration
1. `npm run migrate:create "add_user_preferences"`
2. Edit the generated migration file
3. `npm run migrate:validate` to check D1 compatibility
4. `npm run migrate:dev` to apply locally
5. Test your changes
6. Commit and push for review

#### Production Migration
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Get PR approval
3. Coordinate with team for maintenance window
4. `npm run migrate:prod` (includes safety checks)
5. Monitor application for 30 minutes post-migration

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan

#### If Migration Fails During Application
1. Stop the migration process
2. Run `npm run backup:validate` to check data integrity
3. Review error logs in Wrangler output
4. Contact database administrator
5. Consider manual rollback if safe

#### If Application Issues Post-Migration
1. Check application logs for database errors
2. Run `npm run migrate:status:prod` to verify migration state
3. If issues persist, prepare rollback migration
4. Coordinate with team before applying fixes

### Support Contacts
- **Database Issues:** Database Administrator
- **Migration System:** Lead Developer  
- **Production Issues:** On-call Engineer
- **Emergency:** Team Lead

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Migration execution time
- Database error rates
- Application response times
- Failed migration attempts
- Backup completion rates

### Monitoring Windows
- **First 24 hours:** Continuous monitoring
- **First week:** Daily health checks
- **First month:** Weekly reviews

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All migrations apply successfully
- [ ] No increase in database errors
- [ ] Application performance maintained
- [ ] Team successfully using new workflow
- [ ] Backup system functioning correctly

## Post-Rollout Activities

### Week 1
- [ ] Daily team check-ins on new workflow
- [ ] Monitor migration and backup metrics
- [ ] Address any workflow issues

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Weekly team retrospective
- [ ] Documentation updates based on feedback
- [ ] Process refinement

### Month 1
- [ ] Full system review
- [ ] Performance metrics analysis
- [ ] Team satisfaction survey
- [ ] Final documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Production database corruption**
  - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive backups before migration
- **Extended downtime during migration**  
  - *Mitigation:* Thorough testing in staging, rollback plan

### Medium Risk
- **Team adoption challenges**
  - *Mitigation:* Training sessions, documentation, support
- **Migration state inconsistencies**
  - *Mitigation:* Validation tools, monitoring

### Low Risk
- **Minor workflow disruptions**
  - *Mitigation:* Quick feedback loops, documentation updates

## Communication Plan

### Pre-Rollout
- Team announcement 1 week before
- Training session scheduling
- Documentation distribution

### During Rollout
- Real-time updates in team chat
- Status updates every 30 minutes during production migration
- Immediate notification of any issues

### Post-Rollout
- Completion announcement
- Daily check-ins for first week
- Weekly summaries for first month
