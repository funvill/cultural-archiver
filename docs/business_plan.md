# Business Plan: Cultural Archiver

## Executive Summary

Cultural Archiver is a non-profit digital heritage project whose mission is to **preserve and democratize access to public and cultural artworks worldwide**. Using open data principles, the platform enables anyone to become a _Citizen Cultural Archivist_ by capturing photos, locations, and stories about artworks in their city. These records are openly licensed and contributed to commons-based repositories such as OpenStreetMap, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons.

Our vision is that in ten years, Cultural Archiver will be a **well-known global tool for discovering and understanding public art**, trusted by citizens, artists, educators, and cities alike.

## Problem Statement

Public and cultural artworks are often temporary. Murals fade, buildings are demolished, and installations vanish without record. Currently:

- Discovery is difficult — most works lack plaques or documentation.
- Preservation is inconsistent — if privately run websites disappear, the information disappears too.
- Access is inequitable — only some institutions have the resources to maintain archives.

Without a systematic, open, and accessible approach to documentation, communities lose valuable parts of their heritage.

## Programs & Activities

Cultural Archiver addresses this by:

1. **Digital Archiving Platform** – A web app where users can upload photos and notes of public art, with geolocation, tags, and metadata.
2. **Volunteer & Community Moderation** – Submissions are reviewed by a network of volunteers and staff to ensure accuracy and quality.
3. **Open Data Integration** – Approved records are exported to global commons datasets (OpenStreetMap, Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons).
4. **Outreach & Education** – Workshops, edit-a-thons, and campaigns encourage participation by students, artists, and local residents.

## Target Audiences

- **Everyday people** discovering art in their neighborhoods.
- **Artists** who want to publicize and preserve their work.
- **Cities and arts councils** needing cultural data for preservation and tourism.
- **Researchers and educators** studying urban change and cultural history.

---

## Funding & Sustainability

As a Canadian non-profit society, Cultural Archiver will rely on:

- **Grants** – from arts councils, digital heritage programs, and open data foundations.
- **Donations & Community Support** – through fundraising campaigns and partnerships.
- **Institutional Partnerships** – with municipalities, universities, and archives.

We will **not introduce premium services**; the platform remains free and open by design.

## Costs (Estimated)

Assuming ~100,000 artworks documented annually, most development and moderation will be handled by volunteers. Costs will be focused on infrastructure and administration:

- **Hosting & Infrastructure (Cloudflare, storage, map tiles):** CAD $12,000/year
- **Administration & Compliance (non-profit filings, bookkeeping, insurance):** CAD $5,000/year
- **Miscellaneous Expenses (outreach materials, domain, contingency):** CAD $3,000/year

**Total Estimated Annual Costs:** CAD $20,000

> These costs are expected to **increase over time** as the platform grows, potentially requiring staff roles and expanded infrastructure.

---

## Impact Measurement

We will measure success through:

- Number of artworks documented and approved.
- Geographic spread of contributions (starting in Vancouver, expanding across Canada).
- Number of active contributors and volunteers.
- Partnerships established with cultural institutions and municipalities.
- Use of data in external research, exhibitions, or city planning.

---

## Governance

Cultural Archiver will incorporate as a **non-profit society in Canada**.

- **Board of Directors:** Provide governance and oversight.
- **Advisory Council:** Experts in art, heritage, and open data.
- **Volunteers:** Community members serving as moderators and ambassadors.
- **Staff (eventual):** Minimal paid staff to ensure sustainability (technical coordinator, outreach coordinator).

---

## Partnerships & Allies

Initial outreach targets:

- **Local Arts Councils** (e.g., BC Arts Council).
- **Digital Heritage Programs** (Canada Council for the Arts’ Digital Strategy Fund).
- **Open Data Communities** (OpenStreetMap Canada, Wikimedia Canada).
- **Municipal Partners** (City of Vancouver’s cultural services).
- **Universities** with programs in urban studies, art history, or digital humanities.

---

## Timeline

**Year 1** – Build MVP, pilot in Vancouver.  
**Year 2** – Expand across major Canadian cities; begin applying for major grants.  
**Year 3–5** – Build institutional partnerships; refine moderation system.  
**Year 10** – Become a globally recognized platform for public art discovery and preservation.

## Conclusion

Cultural Archiver is a commons-first project ensuring that **our shared cultural heritage does not vanish with time or depend on private entities**. By empowering communities to document public art and contributing to open datasets, we safeguard cultural memory for future generations.
