# Mass Import v3 Performance Optimization - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully optimized the Mass Import v3 endpoint with batch database operations, reducing query complexity and adding comprehensive performance monitoring.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Batch Artist Lookups

**Before:** Individual queries for each artist (N queries)
```typescript
for (const artistName of artistNames) {
  const artist = await env.DB.prepare('SELECT id, name FROM artists WHERE name = ?')
    .bind(artistName)
    .first();
}
```

**After:** Single batch query with IN clause (1 query)
```typescript
const placeholders = artistNames.map(() => '?').join(', ');
const query = `SELECT id, name FROM artists WHERE name IN (${placeholders})`;
const result = await env.DB.prepare(query)
  .bind(...artistNames)
  .run<{ id: string; name: string }>();
```

### 2. Batch Artist Inserts

**Before:** Individual INSERT for each new artist (M queries)
```typescript
for (const artist of newArtists) {
  await env.DB.prepare('INSERT INTO artists (...) VALUES (...)')
    .bind(...)
    .run();
}
```

**After:** Batch INSERT using D1 batch API (1 batch operation)
```typescript
const statements = artistsToCreate.map(artist =>
  env.DB.prepare('INSERT INTO artists (...) VALUES (...)').bind(...)
);
await env.DB.batch(statements);
```

### 3. Batch Artist Links

**Before:** Individual INSERT for each artist link (N queries)
```typescript
for (const artist of linkedArtists) {
  await env.DB.prepare('INSERT INTO artwork_artists (...) VALUES (...)')
    .bind(...)
    .run();
}
```

**After:** Batch INSERT using D1 batch API (1 batch operation)
```typescript
const linkStatements = linkedArtists.map(artist =>
  env.DB.prepare('INSERT INTO artwork_artists (...) VALUES (...)').bind(...)
);
await env.DB.batch(linkStatements);
```

### 4. Performance Timing Breakdown

Added detailed timing instrumentation to track:
- **Validation:** Zod schema validation time
- **Sanitization:** Markdown sanitization time
- **Artist Processing:** Artist lookup + creation time (combined)
- **Photo Processing:** Photo validation time
- **Artwork Creation:** Artwork INSERT time
- **Artist Linking:** Artist link batch INSERT time
- **Total:** End-to-end request time

Example output (verbose mode):
```typescript
{
  validation: 5,
  sanitization: 1,
  artistProcessing: 45,
  photoProcessing: 120,
  artworkCreation: 8,
  artistLinking: 3,
  total: 182
}
```

## Query Complexity Reduction

### Artwork with 3 Artists

**Before Optimization:**
```
Auth: 2 queries
Artist lookups: 3 queries (1 per artist)
Artist inserts: 3 queries (if all new)
Artwork insert: 1 query
Artist links: 3 queries (1 per artist)
Total: 12 queries
```

**After Optimization:**
```
Auth: 2 queries
Artist batch lookup: 1 query (all artists)
Artist batch insert: 1 batch (all new artists)
Artwork insert: 1 query
Artist batch links: 1 batch (all links)
Total: 5 operations (2 queries + 3 batch ops)
```

**Improvement:** ~58% reduction in database operations

### Artwork with 0 Artists

**Before:** 3 queries (auth + artwork insert)
**After:** 3 queries (no change)
**Improvement:** N/A

### Artwork with 10 Artists

**Before:** 32 queries (2 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10)
**After:** 5 operations (2 + 1 + 1 batch + 1 + 1 batch)
**Improvement:** ~84% reduction

## Test Coverage

- ✅ All 785 tests passing (1 skipped)
- ✅ Added batch operation support to test mocks
- ✅ Verified batch SELECT with IN clause
- ✅ Verified batch INSERT operations
- ✅ Timing breakdowns tested in verbose mode

## Files Modified

1. **src/workers/routes/mass-import-v3/artwork-handler.ts** (350 lines)
   - Replaced sequential artist lookups with batch IN query
   - Replaced sequential artist inserts with batch operation
   - Replaced sequential artist link inserts with batch operation
   - Added timing instrumentation throughout

2. **src/workers/routes/__tests__/mass-import-v3-integration.test.ts** (672 lines)
   - Added `.batch()` support to mock database
   - Added batch SELECT support (IN clause handling)
   - Enhanced mock to handle both individual and batch operations

3. **docs/mass-import-v3-performance-optimization.md** (new)
   - Performance analysis and optimization plan
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Performance targets and monitoring strategy

## Performance Targets Status

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Query reduction | 50-70% | ✅ 58-84% achieved |
| Batch operations | Implemented | ✅ Complete |
| Timing instrumentation | Added | ✅ Complete |
| Test compatibility | All passing | ✅ 785 tests passing |

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on query reduction:
- **Single artwork, 1 artist:** ~33% faster (6 queries → 4 operations)
- **Single artwork, 3 artists:** ~58% faster (12 queries → 5 operations)
- **Single artwork, 10 artists:** ~84% faster (32 queries → 5 operations)

Actual latency improvements will depend on:
- D1 connection latency
- Network round-trip time
- Database load
- Geographic location

## Next Steps

### Phase 8: Integration Testing

Ready to test with real data:
1. Test with OSM artwork scraper data
2. Test with Vancouver art collection data
3. Test with artist JSON imports
4. Measure actual p95 latency in production
5. Validate batch operations under load
