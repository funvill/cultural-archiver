- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + TypeScript + Hono framework (54 tests passing)  
- **Database**: SQLite (Cloudflare D1) with spatial indexing
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for photo processing pipeline
- **Build System**: Monorepo workspace with separate frontend/workers packages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment

### Documentation Status
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md with project vision and tech stack
- ✅ Basic CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- ✅ Extensive docs/ folder with API, database, and architecture docs
- ❌ Missing CHANGELOG.md file
- ⚠️ .github/copilot-instructions.md needs updating for current state

### Quality Status
- ✅ 82 frontend unit tests passing across 9 test files
- ✅ 54 backend tests passing across 5 test suites
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with strict settings
- ⚠️ ESLint not working at root level (dependencies missing)
- ⚠️ Some deprecated dependencies (Miniflare v2, ESLint v8)
- ✅ Prettier configuration present

### Current Issues
