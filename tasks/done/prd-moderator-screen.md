# PRD â€“ Moderator Screen (Review Queue)

## Introduction/Overview

The Moderator Screen is a **review queue interface** where moderators can quickly check user-submitted artwork content for obvious abuse, spam, or inappropriate material. This feature leverages the existing `/api/review/*` endpoints and `ReviewView.vue` frontend component that have already been implemented.

The review system includes a fully functional frontend interface with card-stack layout, keyboard shortcuts, and moderation actions. The system integrates with the implemented UUID-based authentication system with `isReviewer` permission checking.

**Goal**: Enhance the existing moderation workflow with improved permission management, audit trails, and admin capabilities while maintaining the current efficient moderation interface.

**Current Status**: âœ… **Core moderation interface implemented** - The basic review queue with approve/reject functionality is already working. This PRD focuses on adding permission management and audit capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Enhanced Permission Management**: Implement granular moderator and admin permission system with database-backed role management
2. **Audit Trail Implementation**: Add comprehensive logging of all moderation decisions for transparency and accountability
3. **Admin Interface**: Provide admin capabilities for managing moderator permissions and reviewing audit logs
4. **Queue Health Monitoring**: Add tools for admins to monitor moderation queue performance and moderator activity
5. **Enhanced Security**: Strengthen permission validation and add admin-specific security controls

## User Stories

### Core Moderator Stories

- **US-1**: As a moderator, I want to quickly see if a photo is appropriate so I can approve good content fast
- **US-2**: As a moderator, I want keyboard shortcuts so I can moderate efficiently without using mouse
- **US-3**: As a moderator, I want to skip submissions I'm unsure about so I don't block the queue

### Admin Stories (**ðŸš§ New Requirements**)

- **US-4**: As an admin, I want to assign moderator permissions so I can manage the moderation team
- **US-5**: As an admin, I want to see queue health and moderator activity so I know if moderation is keeping up
- **US-6**: As an admin, I want to review audit logs so I can monitor moderation decisions and resolve disputes

### Enhanced Security Stories (**ðŸš§ New Requirements**)

- **US-7**: As a system admin, I want comprehensive audit trails so I can track all moderation actions
- **US-8**: As an admin, I want to manage permission escalation so I can grant/revoke admin access securely

### Accessibility Stories

- **US-9**: As a moderator using screen reader, I want proper labels so I can moderate accessibly

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Advanced Moderation Features**: No crowdsourced voting, trust scores, or user reputation systems _(unchanged)_
- **Fact-Checking Workflows**: Moderators only check for abuse, not content accuracy _(unchanged)_
- **Metadata Editing**: No capability to edit submission content during review _(future feature)_
- **Batch Operations**: No multi-select or bulk approve/reject functionality _(future feature)_
- **Mobile Optimization**: Desktop-first interface _(mobile support via responsive design already implemented)_
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: No detailed moderation speed tracking or moderator leaderboards _(basic statistics already implemented)_
- **Advanced Filtering**: No filtering by submission type, location, or date ranges _(basic filtering already implemented)_
- **Appeal Process**: No mechanism for users to contest rejected submissions _(future feature)_
- **UI/UX Changes**: The existing ReviewView.vue interface will not be redesigned _(interface already optimized)_

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Card-Stack Layout**: Single submission visible with clear action buttons
- **Minimal Interface**: Focus on content and actions, minimal clutter
- **Standard Buttons**: Uses existing component library button styles
- **Toast Notifications**: Uses application's existing toast system
- **Responsive Text**: Submission notes and metadata clearly readable

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality via keyboard shortcuts
- **High Contrast**: Sufficient color contrast for action buttons
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators

### New Admin Interface Requirements (**ðŸš§ New**)

- **Permission Management UI**: Simple interface for granting/revoking moderator permissions
- **Audit Log Viewer**: Searchable table of moderation decisions with filtering
- **Queue Statistics Dashboard**: Enhanced metrics beyond current basic statistics
- **Admin Actions Logging**: All admin actions must be logged separately from moderation decisions

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Extensions (**ðŸš§ New Requirements**)

```sql
-- New permissions table (extends existing authentication system)
CREATE TABLE user_permissions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_uuid TEXT NOT NULL,
  permission TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (permission IN ('moderator', 'admin')),
  granted_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  granted_by TEXT NOT NULL, -- UUID of admin who granted permission
  revoked_at TEXT NULL,
  revoked_by TEXT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_uuid) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (granted_by) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (revoked_by) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Enhanced moderation decisions audit table
CREATE TABLE moderation_decisions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  submission_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  moderator_uuid TEXT NOT NULL,
  decision TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (decision IN ('approved', 'rejected', 'skipped')),
  rejection_reason TEXT NULL,
  notes TEXT NULL,
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  session_info TEXT NULL, -- JSON with IP, user agent, etc.
  FOREIGN KEY (submission_id) REFERENCES logbook(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (moderator_uuid) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Admin actions audit table
CREATE TABLE admin_actions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  admin_uuid TEXT NOT NULL,
  action_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'grant_permission', 'revoke_permission', etc.
  target_uuid TEXT, -- User affected by action
  details TEXT, -- JSON with action details
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  FOREIGN KEY (admin_uuid) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (target_uuid) REFERENCES users(uuid) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### API Integration

- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth middleware with `isReviewer` checks
- **Queue Endpoint**: Uses existing `/api/review/queue` with pagination
- **Action Endpoints**: Uses existing `/api/review/approve` and `/api/review/reject`
- Permission validation using database records instead of hardcoded logic
- Admin endpoints for permission management (`/api/admin/permissions`)
- Audit endpoints for decision tracking (`/api/admin/audit`)

### Frontend Architecture

- **Vue Router**: `/review` route with beforeEnter guard
- **Components**: Functional `ReviewView.vue` with card interface
- **State Management**: Uses existing auth store for permission checking
- Admin interface components for permission management
- Audit log viewing components
- Enhanced permission checking using database-backed roles

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

1. **Functional Moderation**: Moderators can successfully approve/reject submissions using the interface
2. **Permission Security**: Only authorized moderators can access the review interface
3. **Performance**: Queue loads and actions complete within 2 seconds on standard connections
4. **Accessibility**: Interface passes WCAG AA compliance testing

### Enhanced Success Criteria

1. **Database-Backed Permissions**: All permission checks use database records instead of hardcoded logic
2. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All moderation decisions are logged with detailed metadata
3. **Admin Management**: Admins can grant/revoke moderator permissions through UI interface
4. **Audit Transparency**: Admin users can review complete moderation decision history

### Post-Launch Metrics (Not in MVP)

- Enhanced moderation queue processing analytics
- Permission change audit reports
- Moderator activity tracking and insights
- System security and access monitoring

## Open Questions

1. **Admin Interface Location**: Should admin permission management be a separate `/admin` route or integrated into the existing `/review` interface?

2. **Permission Granularity**: Should we implement role-based permissions (moderator, admin) or more granular permissions (approve_submissions, manage_users, view_audit_logs)?

3. **Audit Log Retention**: How long should moderation decision logs be retained, and should there be automatic cleanup policies?

4. **Permission Bootstrap**: How should the first admin user be created? Should this be done via database migration, environment variable, or special setup interface?

5. **Audit Log Access**: Should regular moderators have access to view their own moderation history, or should audit logs be admin-only?

6. **Performance Optimization**: Should permission checks be cached in Redis/KV storage to avoid database queries on every request?

7. **Security Alerts**: Should the system generate alerts for suspicious admin actions (mass permission changes, bulk rejections, etc.)?
