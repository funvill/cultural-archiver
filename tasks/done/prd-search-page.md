# PRD: Search Page

## Introduction/Overview

The Search Page feature enables users to discover artworks through a dedicated search interface. This feature addresses the core user need of finding specific artworks within the cultural archiver platform. The search page will provide a simple, focused search experience that allows users to search for artworks using basic string queries with potential for advanced syntax in future iterations.

**Goal:** Provide users with an efficient way to search and discover artworks in the cultural archiver database through a dedicated search interface.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable users to search for artworks using basic text queries
2. **User Experience Goal:** Provide a clean, intuitive search interface accessible to all users
3. **Technical Goal:** Implement proper full-text search capabilities for good performance
4. **Scope Goal:** Deliver a focused MVP that can be extended with advanced features later

## User Stories

1. **As a visitor**, I want to access a search page from the main navigation so that I can search for artworks without needing to create an account.

2. **As a user**, I want to enter search terms in a search bar with helpful placeholder text so that I understand how to use the search functionality.

3. **As a user**, I want to see search results displayed as artwork cards with titles and thumbnails so that I can quickly browse and identify relevant artworks.

4. **As a user**, I want to click on an artwork card to navigate to its detail page so that I can learn more about the artwork.

5. **As a user**, I want to see skeleton loading cards while my search is processing so that I understand the system is working and know what to expect.

6. **As a user**, I want to see a clear message when no results are found so that I know my search completed but found nothing.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Search Functionality

1. The system must provide a dedicated search page accessible via navigation menu link labeled "Search"
2. The system must display a search input field with search icon inside the input
3. The system must include placeholder text showing syntax examples (e.g., "Search artworks... try: mural, tag:street-art")
4. The system must implement full-text search across artwork titles, descriptions, and tags
5. The system must support basic string search as the primary search method
6. The system must process searches for anonymous users (no authentication required)

### Search Results Display

1. The system must display search results as artwork cards in a responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2-3 columns on desktop)
2. Each artwork card must display: artwork title and thumbnail image
3. The system must implement infinite scroll loading for search results
4. The system must make artwork cards clickable, navigating to the artwork detail page in the same tab

### User Interface & Experience

1. The system must show search tips and example queries on initial page load (before any search is performed)
2. The system must display skeleton cards in the results area while search is processing
3. The system must show "No results found" message when search returns zero results
4. The system must use URL structure `/search/{query}` for search queries
5. The system must be fully responsive and work consistently across all devices

### Performance & Technical

1. The system must implement proper full-text search capabilities (not basic LIKE queries)
2. The system must handle search queries without validation initially (pass terms as-is to backend)
3. The system must process and return search results within reasonable time limits

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Creator search functionality** - Only artwork search in MVP
2. **Advanced search filters** - No location, date, or category filters in MVP
3. **Tag syntax search (`tag:tagname`)** - Basic string search only for MVP
4. **Creator syntax search (`creator:name`)** - Not included in MVP
5. **Field syntax search (`field:key:value`)** - Not included in MVP
6. **Saved searches** - No user account integration for search history
7. **Search suggestions/autocomplete** - Basic input only
8. **Advanced validation** - No syntax checking or error handling for special formats
9. **Location-based search results** - No distance or geographic filtering

## Design Considerations

### Layout & Structure

- **Page Structure:** Search bar with quick tips/examples visible, followed by results area
- **Search Input:** Text input with search icon inside, no separate search button
- **Card Grid:** Responsive layout that adapts from single column (mobile) to 2-3 columns (desktop)
- **Typography:** Follow existing Tailwind CSS design system used throughout the application

### Visual Hierarchy

- Search input should be prominent and clearly the primary action
- Search tips should be visible but not compete with the main search functionality
- Artwork cards should have clear visual hierarchy with title prominently displayed
- Maintain consistency with existing artwork card designs used elsewhere in the application

### Loading States

- Use skeleton cards that match the dimensions and layout of actual artwork cards
- Skeleton cards should appear in the same grid layout as real results
- Loading state should provide clear feedback that search is in progress

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Implementation

- **Framework:** Implement using Vue 3 with TypeScript following existing frontend architecture
- **Routing:** Add `/search/{query}` route to Vue Router configuration
- **State Management:** Use Pinia store for search state if needed, otherwise keep local component state
- **API Integration:** Integrate with existing API service layer in `src/frontend/src/services/`

### Backend Requirements

- **Search Endpoint:** Implement or extend existing API endpoint to handle full-text search queries
- **Database:** Utilize proper full-text search capabilities (SQLite FTS or similar)
- **Performance:** Ensure search queries are optimized and use appropriate indexing
- **Response Format:** Return artwork data in format compatible with existing artwork card components

### Integration Points

- **Navigation:** Add search link to existing navigation component
- **Artwork Cards:** Reuse existing artwork card component design and functionality
- **API Layer:** Extend existing API service methods for search functionality
- **Error Handling:** Follow existing error handling patterns used in other API calls

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Success:** Users can successfully search for and find artworks using basic text queries
2. **Performance Success:** Search results load within 2 seconds for typical queries
3. **User Experience Success:** Search interface is intuitive enough that users can use it without instruction
4. **Technical Success:** Search functionality works reliably across all supported browsers and devices
5. **Scope Success:** MVP delivers core search value while maintaining clear path for future enhancements

## Open Questions

1. **Search Result Ranking:** What algorithm should be used to rank search results? (Relevance, recency, popularity?)
2. **Search Analytics:** Should we track search queries for future feature planning?
3. **Cache Strategy:** Should search results be cached, and if so, for how long?
4. **Pagination Fallback:** If infinite scroll fails, should there be a pagination fallback option?
5. **Mobile Keyboard:** Should the search input have any special mobile keyboard attributes (search button, etc.)?
6. **Empty Query Handling:** What should happen if user submits an empty search query?
7. **Special Characters:** How should searches with special characters or symbols be handled?
8. **Future Syntax:** When advanced search syntax is added later, how will we maintain backward compatibility?

## Implementation Notes

This PRD focuses on delivering a clean, functional search MVP that provides immediate value to users while establishing a foundation for future search enhancements. The simplified scope ensures quick delivery while the technical foundation (full-text search) ensures good performance and extensibility.

The design should feel integrated with the existing application while being distinct enough that users recognize it as a dedicated search experience.
