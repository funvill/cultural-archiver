### Notes

- The project uses a monorepo structure with separate configurations for
  frontend and workers
- Node.js v23+ native TypeScript support eliminates compilation steps for
  development
- Cloudflare resources (D1, KV, R2) will be created through the Cloudflare
  dashboard initially
- GitHub repository settings and branch protection will be configured through
  the GitHub web interface
- All TypeScript configurations use strict mode for better code quality
- Development scripts can run TypeScript files directly with `node file.ts` (no
  transpilation needed)
