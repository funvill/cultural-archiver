# PRD: Image Handling & Rate Limiting System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the implementation of a robust image handling pipeline and rate limiting system for the Cultural Archiver MVP. The image handling system processes user-uploaded photos through comprehensive server-side optimization using Cloudflare R2 storage with proper filename generation, validation, and metadata management. The rate limiting system protects against abuse using Cloudflare KV storage while ensuring legitimate users can contribute effectively to the cultural mapping platform.

**Problem Statement:** The Cultural Archiver application now has comprehensive API endpoints and photo processing infrastructure but needs enhancement for production-ready image optimization, EXIF handling, and consent management systems.

**Goal:** Complete the image handling system with Cloudflare Images integration, implement comprehensive consent collection, and enhance the existing photo processing pipeline for production deployment.

## Goals

1. **Complete Image Processing Pipeline**: Integrate Cloudflare Images with existing R2 storage for automatic optimization and thumbnail generation ‚úÖ _Photo processing utilities implemented_
2. **EXIF Metadata Preservation**: Implement EXIF data preservation including GPS coordinates and permalink injection ‚ùå _Not yet implemented_
3. **Enhanced Abuse Prevention**: Leverage existing rate limiting with comprehensive monitoring and consent systems ‚úÖ _Rate limiting fully implemented_
4. **Legal Compliance**: Implement comprehensive consent collection and Canadian Freedom of Panorama guidance ‚ùå _Not yet implemented_
5. **Production Optimization**: Enhance existing storage structure and delivery through CDN integration ‚ö†Ô∏è _Partially implemented_
6. **Complete User Experience**: Build upon existing upload feedback with consent workflows and enhanced error messaging ‚ö†Ô∏è _API implemented, UI pending_

## User Stories

### Image Handling

- **As a contributor**, I want to upload photos from my mobile device so that I can document public art while on location
- **As a contributor**, I want my photos to be automatically optimized for web viewing so that they load quickly for others
- **As a site visitor**, I want to see high-quality thumbnails in the map view so that I can quickly identify artwork
- **As a content moderator**, I want access to original photos so that I can verify submissions for accuracy

### Rate Limiting & Protection

- **As a platform operator**, I want to prevent spam submissions so that the quality of the archive remains high
- **As a legitimate user**, I want clear feedback when I hit rate limits so that I understand when I can submit again
- **As a legal team member**, I want proper consent collection so that we can use submitted content legally
- **As a content moderator**, I want audit trails for takedowns so that we can respond to legal requests
