# Progress: Photo Aggregation Issue Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-21  
**Issue**: Photos from logbook entries stored in wrong field during approval process  
**Goal**: Fix photo aggregation so logbook photos appear in artwork details page

## Major Tasks

### [X] 1. Identify Database Schema and Current State

- [x] Confirmed artwork table exists with proper schema
- [x] Analyzed submissions table with approved logbook entries
- [x] Identified photo storage issue in approval process

### [X] 2. Root Cause Analysis

- [x] Found photos are stored in `artwork.tags._photos` instead of `artwork.photos`
- [x] Confirmed artwork.photos field is NULL for all records
- [x] Verified logbook submissions have photos in correct format
- [x] Identified approval process bug

### [ ] 3. Fix Approval Process

- [ ] Examine approval code in review.ts
- [ ] Identify why photos go to tags.\_photos instead of photos field
- [ ] Fix photo storage logic during approval
- [ ] Test photo aggregation fix

### [ ] 4. Migrate Existing Data

- [ ] Create migration script to move photos from tags.\_photos to photos field
- [ ] Apply migration to development database
- [ ] Verify existing artworks show photos correctly

## Summary: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED! ✅

**THE BUG**: The `updateArtworkPhotos()` function in `src/workers/lib/database.ts` was storing photos in the `artwork.tags._photos` JSON field instead of the dedicated `artwork.photos` field.

**THE FIX**:

1. ✅ **Fixed `updateArtworkPhotos()`**: Now stores photos in `artwork.photos` field
2. ✅ **Fixed `getPhotosFromArtwork()`**: Now reads from `artwork.photos` with fallback to legacy `tags._photos`
3. ✅ **Created migration 0022**: Moved existing photos from `tags._photos` to `photos` field
4. ✅ **Applied migration**: All existing artworks now have photos in correct field

**VERIFICATION**:

- Before: `artwork.photos` = NULL, `artwork.tags` = `{"artwork_type":"unknown","_photos":[...]}`
- After: `artwork.photos` = `["/photos/artworks/..."]`, `artwork.tags` = `{"artwork_type":"unknown"}`

**STATUS**: ✅ **BUG FIXED** - Photos should now appear correctly in artwork details page

## Summary: Current Implementation Analysis

### **Database State Analysis**:

Looking at the database dump, I can see there **IS** an artwork table with three approved artwork records:

1. **First artwork** (`b4617675...`):
   - `photos` field: `NULL`
   - `tags`: `{"keywords":"","condition":"good","artwork_type":"tiny_library"}`
   - **No photos stored anywhere**

2. **Second artwork** (`c937b542...`):
   - `photos` field: `NULL`
   - `tags`: `{"artwork_type":"tiny_library","condition":"good","_photos":["/photos/artworks/2025/09/19/20250920-030142-5360fb3b-PXL_20250820_0208394.jpg"]}`
   - **Photos incorrectly stored in tags.\_photos**

3. **Third artwork** (`e7ebd36a...`):
   - `photos` field: `NULL`
   - `tags`: `{"artwork_type":"unknown","_photos":["/photos/artworks/2025/09/21/20250921-193648-7696073e-PXL_20250820_0216174.jpg"]}`
   - **Photos incorrectly stored in tags.\_photos**

### **Corresponding Logbook Submissions**:

All logbook entries were properly approved and linked to artworks:

- `7211d79f...` → artwork `b4617675...` (approved, has photos in submission)
- `87b55551...` → artwork `c937b542...` (approved, has photos in submission)
- `b8ff3859...` → artwork `e7ebd36a...` (approved, has photos in submission)

### **The Bug**:

During the approval process, photos from logbook submissions are being stored in the `artwork.tags._photos` JSON field instead of the dedicated `artwork.photos` field. This causes:

1. ❌ **Artwork details API doesn't find photos** (looks in `photos` field)
2. ❌ **Photo aggregation logic fails** (expects photos in `photos` field)
3. ❌ **Frontend doesn't display logbook photos** (API returns empty photos array)

### **Expected vs Actual Behavior**:

**Expected**:

```sql
artwork.photos = '["["/photos/artworks/2025/09/21/..."]']'
artwork.tags = '{"artwork_type":"unknown"}'
```

**Actual**:

```sql
artwork.photos = NULL
artwork.tags = '{"artwork_type":"unknown","_photos":["["/photos/artworks/2025/09/21/..."]'}'
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Examine approval process code** to find where photos are being incorrectly stored in tags
2. **Fix the bug** so photos go to the proper `photos` field during approval
3. **Create migration** to move existing photos from `tags._photos` to `photos` field
4. **Test the fix** by submitting a new logbook entry

## Technical Notes:

- The API response showing photos working suggests the backend has fallback logic to read from `tags._photos`
- This explains why you can see photos in API response but they're not persisted correctly
- The photo aggregation logic needs to be fixed at the approval stage, not the API level
