# Feature Definition: Mass Import Tag Merging

This document outlines the requirements for the "Mass Import Tag Merging" feature based on the clarifying questions answered.

## Intial feature description

When running the mass-import and a duplicate is found. Check the tags, add any new tags to the existing recored, don't overwrite the existing tags.


## 1. Goals & High-Level Vision

* **Primary Goal:** To enrich existing artwork data by merging new tags from duplicate imports, preventing data loss.
* **Conflict Handling:** When a tag with the same `label` but a different `value` is found, the existing tag's value will be kept, and the new one will be discarded.
* **Duplicate Data Handling:** The imported artwork data will be discarded after its tags are merged into an existing record.
* **Primary Audience:** The system administrator running the `mass-import` script.
* **Communication:** The outcome of the tag merge will be communicated via a detailed console log message during the script's execution.
