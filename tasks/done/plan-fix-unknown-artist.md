## Plan: Fix artworks with "Unknown Artist" by using `artist_name` in tags

 
### Goal
Populate the `artworks.artist` field for records where it is currently "Unknown Artist" using the `artist_name` value embedded in the `tags` JSON column.

 
### Overview
 
- Work entirely on a local/staging copy of the production dump first. Do not run any destructive updates directly on production.
- Create an audit table capturing artwork id, old_artist, extracted artist_name, and timestamp.
- Populate the audit table only for rows where an `artist_name` can be reliably extracted.
- Run a single transactional update that sets `artworks.artist` from the audit table.
- Keep the audit table after the update and export it to CSV for review; this allows easy rollback using the stored `old_artist` values.

 
### Assumptions

- The production dump is available at `_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql` (already present in repo backups).
- `artworks` table has at least these columns: `id` (TEXT/UUID), `artist` (TEXT), `tags` (TEXT containing JSON).
- `tags` JSON appears in a few common shapes: a root object with `artist_name`, or an array of objects with `key`/`value` or `name`/`value` fields, or an array of strings containing `artist_name` references.
- Using SQLite (Cloudflare D1 compatible) JSON functions like `json_extract` and `json_each` is acceptable.

 
### Plan steps (high level)
 
1) Create a local test database from the production SQL dump.
2) Run discovery queries to count candidate rows and sample extractions.
3) Create the audit table and insert one row per artwork with the extracted artist_name.
4) Verify extracted values (counts and spot-check sample rows).
5) Run the transactional update in staging/local DB.
6) Export the audit table for human review and sign-off.
7) Option A (migration): Commit a migration SQL file into `src/workers/migrations/` and apply using the migration tooling.
   Option B (replace DB): Generate a new production DB file from the dump + migration and swap the DB used in production.
8) Monitor and rollback if needed.

 
### Discovery SQL (preview extraction)
Use this query to preview how artist_name is found in `tags` for artworks where `artist = 'Unknown Artist'`.

```sql
SELECT a.id,
       a.artist AS old_artist,
       json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_name') AS root_artist_name,
       (SELECT json_extract(je.value, '$.value')
        FROM json_each(a.tags) je
        WHERE json_extract(je.value, '$.key') = 'artist_name'
           OR json_extract(je.value, '$.name') = 'artist_name'
        LIMIT 1) AS array_obj_artist_name,
       (SELECT je.value FROM json_each(a.tags) je WHERE je.value LIKE '%"artist_name"%' LIMIT 1) AS fallback_value
FROM artworks a
WHERE a.artist = 'Unknown Artist'
LIMIT 500;
```

 
### Audit + Update SQL (transactional)
Run this on your local/staging DB once you've validated the extraction logic. It creates an `artist_name_updates` audit table, inserts extracted values, and updates `artworks.artist` atomically.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artist_name_updates (
  artwork_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  old_artist TEXT,
  extracted_artist TEXT,
  applied_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

INSERT OR REPLACE INTO artist_name_updates (artwork_id, old_artist, extracted_artist, applied_at)
SELECT a.id,
       a.artist,
       TRIM(COALESCE(
         json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_name'),
         (SELECT json_extract(je.value, '$.value')
          FROM json_each(a.tags) je
          WHERE json_extract(je.value, '$.key') = 'artist_name'
             OR json_extract(je.value, '$.name') = 'artist_name'
          LIMIT 1),
         (SELECT je.value FROM json_each(a.tags) je WHERE je.value LIKE '%"artist_name"%' LIMIT 1)
       )) AS extracted_artist,
       datetime('now')
FROM artworks a
WHERE a.artist = 'Unknown Artist'
  AND TRIM(COALESCE(
         json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_name'),
         (SELECT json_extract(je.value, '$.value')
          FROM json_each(a.tags) je
          WHERE json_extract(je.value, '$.key') = 'artist_name'
             OR json_extract(je.value, '$.name') = 'artist_name'
          LIMIT 1),
         (SELECT je.value FROM json_each(a.tags) je WHERE je.value LIKE '%"artist_name"%' LIMIT 1)
      )) IS NOT NULL;

-- Apply updates using audit table
UPDATE artworks
SET artist = (
  SELECT extracted_artist FROM artist_name_updates u WHERE u.artwork_id = artworks.id
)
WHERE id IN (SELECT artwork_id FROM artist_name_updates);

COMMIT;

## Latest session status (2025-10-07)

- I completed discovery and matching runs on a local copy of the production dump and produced reviewable artifacts under `reports/discovery/`.
- CSVs produced and available for review:
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_updated.csv` — audit candidates after matching (805 rows).
   - `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` — rows previously inserted into `artwork_artists` (exported for review).
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_review.csv` — audit rows with `action` column (`no-match`, `already-linked`, `will-insert`).
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_to_apply.csv` — actionable-only CSV (rows that would actually insert). This file is empty for the current discovery DB (no actionable inserts remain because matched candidates are already linked).

Notes:
- You reviewed random samples of `artist_name_updates_updated.csv` and `artwork_artist_linking.csv` and confirmed they looked good.
- The `artist_name_updates_to_apply.csv` being empty means the linking step has already been applied to the discovery DB or the links already existed; the migration is idempotent and will not create duplicates in production.

---

## Migration readiness & recommended next actions

1) Final review (you or the data steward)
   - Open `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_review.csv` and filter to `action = 'will-insert'` (should be empty for the discovery DB). If non-empty on production, review those rows carefully.
   - Spot-check `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` (already done) for correctness.

2) Prepare PR (I can draft this)
   - Add `src/workers/migrations/0031_link_artists_from_audit.sql` to the PR (already present in the repo). Include the migration description, preflight checks, and rollback SQL in the PR body.
   - Attach `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_review.csv` and `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` (or provide a direct path) for reviewers.
   - Request reviews from: data steward, backend reviewer, and an ops/infra reviewer.

3) Running the migration in prod (Option A — recommended)
   - Make a full DB backup and store it in `_backup_database/` with timestamp before migrating.
   - Run migrations non-interactively: `CI=true npm run database:migration:prod` (or your verified prod migration command). Ensure `CI=true` to avoid interactive prompts.
   - Verify migration success and run the post-migration checks (counts, duplicates check, smoke tests) outlined earlier in this file.

4) Rollback plan (if needed)
   - Use the `artist_linking_audit` table created/updated by the migration to remove inserted rows and restore `artworks.artist` values (SQL snippet included in migration file and earlier in this doc).
   - Full DB restore is available from the pre-migration backup if a full rollback is necessary.

## PR body template (copy into new PR)

Title: 0031 — Link artists from `artist_name_updates` audit and record `artist_linking_audit`

Description:
- This migration inserts missing rows from `artist_name_updates` into `artwork_artists` where a safe `matched_artist_id` exists. It is idempotent and records operations in `artist_linking_audit`.

Preflight checklist:
- [ ] Confirm `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_review.csv` reviewed and sign-off obtained.
- [ ] Production DB backup created and uploaded to `_backup_database/`.
- [ ] CI green for migration PR.

Post-migration checks:
- Run the counts and duplicate checks listed in the migration plan.

Rollback:
- Use `artist_linking_audit` to remove inserted rows and restore `artworks.artist` where appropriate. Full restore is also possible from the backup.

Attachments:
- `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_review.csv`
- `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv`

---

If you want, I can create the PR now and attach the CSVs. I can also run a conservative token-splitting pass and propose additional insertions for multi-artist extracted strings (separate change). Which would you like me to do next?
```

 
### Rollback SQL (if needed)
If you need to revert the change, use the audit table to restore `old_artist` values:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE artworks
SET artist = (SELECT old_artist FROM artist_name_updates u WHERE u.artwork_id = artworks.id)
WHERE id IN (SELECT artwork_id FROM artist_name_updates);
COMMIT;
```

 

### Local Linux / macOS test/run steps (bash)

- Ensure `sqlite3` is installed and on PATH. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sqlite3`.
- Work on a copy of the production dump. The repo already contains `_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql`.

I added a convenience script `scripts/run_discovery.sh` which will create a local DB from the dump and save useful discovery artifacts under `reports/discovery/` by default.

Basic usage (from repo root):

```bash
# create a local DB and run discovery
scripts/run_discovery.sh _backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql reports/discovery

# or, run manually:
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read '_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql'"
sqlite3 -header -column reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT id, artist, json_extract(tags, '$.artist_name') FROM artworks WHERE artist = 'Unknown Artist' LIMIT 50;" > reports/discovery/discovery-sample.txt

# Run the non-destructive update SQL (after you verify discovery results)
# NOTE: run this only on a copy of the DB in reports/discovery
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read 'scripts/sql/update_artist_from_tags.sql'"

# Quick checks and export audit table
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT count(*) FROM artist_name_updates;"
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db -csv "SELECT * FROM artist_name_updates;" > reports/discovery/artist_name_updates.csv
```

 
### Validation checklist
--------------------
 
- Number of rows in `artist_name_updates` matches expected candidate count.
- Randomly spot-check 20 artworks from the audit table: confirm the front-end and database now show the extracted artist correctly.
- Confirm no rows were updated where `extracted_artist` is empty or only whitespace.
- Run `npm run build:frontend` / smoke test if you have a staging environment to ensure no rendering regressions.

 
### Deployment options
------------------
 
- Migration file: Create a migration in `src/workers/migrations/000X_update_artist_from_tags.sql` (choose next sequence number) and apply using your migration commands (`npm run database:migration:prod` or the project's normal process). This makes the change auditable and reversible via the rollback SQL.
- Database replacement: If you prefer replacing the production DB entirely, apply the script to the dumped SQL locally, build a new DB file, verify, then swap. This is riskier but acceptable in pre-release environments.

 
### Follow-ups / improvements
-------------------------
- Extend extraction to handle more tag shapes if you discover new patterns during discovery. Add extra parsing rules to the INSERT SELECT logic.
- Add a lightweight script in `scripts/` to run discovery, run the update, and export the audit CSV. This can help reviewers run the process locally without manual sqlite3 calls.
- Add a small unit test in the workers test suite to validate extraction logic on example `tags` JSON shapes.

Requirements coverage
---------------------
- Backup and local testing: Done (instructions provided).  
- Discovery + sample: Done (discovery SQL included).  
- Atomic update + audit: Done (transactional SQL included).  
- Rollback: Done (rollback SQL included).  
- Deployment guidance: Done (migration vs replace options).  

Contact
-------
If you'd like, I can create the migration SQL file in `src/workers/migrations/` with the next sequential number and a small Node/TS script to run the discovery + update steps. Tell me whether you prefer a migration file or DB replacement and I will proceed.

### Milestone 2 — link by `artist_ids` and update artwork artist

 
#### Problem
Some artworks have `artist = 'Unknown Artist'` but include a `tags` entry `artist_ids` containing a comma-separated list of numeric artist ids (for example: `"90,144,145"`). Those numeric ids correspond to `artist_id` values stored on artist records (for example an artist page may have a tag `"artist_id":145` or a dedicated column `artist_id`). We need to:

- Parse `artist_ids` from artwork tags.
- Find the primary/most relevant artist record for the artwork using the numeric ids (prefer the last id in the list if that matches your front-end convention; otherwise prefer the highest confidence match).
- Link the artwork to the artist (insert into join table if your schema uses a separate artwork_artists table) and set `artworks.artist` to the artist's canonical name.

 
#### Discovery SQL
Preview rows that have `artist_ids` in tags and show the parsed id list and candidate artist records.

```sql
SELECT a.id AS artwork_id,
          a.artist,
          json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_ids') AS artist_ids_raw,
          -- split CSV: pick first/last candidate (SQLite doesn't have split, but we can find patterns)
          -- try last id using reverse-like logic (simple helper expression)
          TRIM(substr(json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_ids'), instr(json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_ids'), ',') + 1)) AS last_candidate -- fallback simple pick
FROM artworks a
WHERE a.artist = 'Unknown Artist'
   AND json_extract(a.tags, '$.artist_ids') IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 200;
```

Note: the above is a lightweight preview. In practice we'll use `json_each` on a replaced string or a small script to robustly split on commas and trim values.

 
#### Linking + Update approach
 
1) Create an audit table `artist_id_link_updates` capturing artwork_id, artist_ids_raw, chosen_artist_id, chosen_artist_uuid, chosen_artist_name, old_artist.
2) For each artwork with `artist_ids`:
    - split the CSV into numeric ids (90,144,145)
    - for each numeric id, search the `artists` table for a tag or column matching that numeric id. Two common storage places:
       - `artists.tags` JSON containing `"artist_id": 145`
       - `artists.artist_id` numeric/text column (if present)
    - choose which artist to link:
       - If exactly one match across the list, choose that.
       - If multiple matches, prefer the last id in the list (or highest match confidence). Document the rule and spot-check.
3) Insert a row into the join table if your schema uses `artwork_artists(artwork_id, artist_uuid)` or similar. If no join table exists, consider creating one to represent many-to-many relationships.
4) Update `artworks.artist` with the `artists.name` (canonical) for the chosen artist.

 
#### Transactional SQL sketch (pseudo-SQL; adapt to exact schema)
This example assumes:
 
- `artists` table has `id` (UUID primary key), `name` (TEXT), and either `artist_id` column (INTEGER) or `tags` JSON with `artist_id`.
- There is a join table `artwork_artists(artwork_id TEXT, artist_id TEXT)`; if not present, the script will create one.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artist_id_link_updates (
   artwork_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
   artist_ids_raw TEXT,
   chosen_artist_id INTEGER,
   chosen_artist_uuid TEXT,
   chosen_artist_name TEXT,
   old_artist TEXT,
   applied_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

-- This requires a small helper: we can expand rows by splitting CSV using a simple JS/TS helper or using recursive CTE.
-- For clarity, run a small script that:
--  1) reads artworks with artist_ids
--  2) splits artist_ids into numeric ids
--  3) queries artists table for matches
--  4) inserts into artist_id_link_updates the chosen match

-- Apply updates based on audit table
-- create join table if needed
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artwork_artists (
   artwork_id TEXT,
   artist_uuid TEXT,
   PRIMARY KEY (artwork_id, artist_uuid)
);

-- Insert join rows and update artworks
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO artwork_artists (artwork_id, artist_uuid)
SELECT artwork_id, chosen_artist_uuid FROM artist_id_link_updates u WHERE u.chosen_artist_uuid IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE artworks
SET artist = (
   SELECT chosen_artist_name FROM artist_id_link_updates u WHERE u.artwork_id = artworks.id
)
WHERE id IN (SELECT artwork_id FROM artist_id_link_updates);

COMMIT;
```

 
#### PowerShell helper recommendation
Because splitting CSV and matching numeric IDs against artist tags is easier in a scripting language, I recommend a small PowerShell or Node script that:

1) Reads the local DB.
2) For each artwork where `json_extract(tags,'$.artist_ids') IS NOT NULL`:
    - Parse the CSV into integers.
    - For each id, try to find an artist record where `artist_id` column = id, or where `json_extract(artists.tags, '$.artist_id') = id`.
    - Choose the match using your chosen rule (exact single match, else last id match).
    - Insert into `artist_id_link_updates` and optionally into `artwork_artists`.
3) After the script populates the audit table, run the SQL to apply updates and exports for review.

Example PowerShell pseudo-steps

```powershell
$localDb = "prod_copy.db"
# Query artworks with artist_ids
$artworks = sqlite3 $localDb "SELECT id, json_extract(tags, '$.artist_ids') FROM artworks WHERE json_extract(tags, '$.artist_ids') IS NOT NULL;"
foreach ($row in $artworks) {
   # parse CSV, lookup artists in artists table, decide chosen artist
   # insert row into artist_id_link_updates using sqlite3 parameterized INSERT
}
# When audit table is ready, apply updates using the SQL shown earlier
```

 
#### Validation and rollback
 
- Export `artist_id_link_updates` to CSV and review chosen matches before applying them in production.
- Rollback is identical to the first migration: use the `old_artist` column in the audit table to restore artists.

 
#### Notes and edge cases
 
- Some artwork `artist_ids` may reference artists that no longer exist — insert a warning into the audit table and skip.
- Where multiple artist ids match multiple artist records, pick a deterministic rule and document it (e.g., prefer last id, or prefer artist with `is_primary = 1` if that flag exists).
- Consider creating or reusing a join table `artwork_artists` to model many-to-many relationships rather than stuffing a single `artworks.artist` field.

## Local discovery commands (PowerShell)

If you want to run discovery on a local copy of the production dump, these PowerShell steps are copy-paste ready. They assume you're in the repository root and the dump path is `_backup_database\database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql`.

1) (Optional) Install sqlite3 locally (simple, no admin):

```powershell
# create local tools folder
$dest = "$PWD\tools\sqlite"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dest -Force

# Download a precompiled sqlite3 zip (adjust URL/version if required)
$zipUrl = "https://www.sqlite.org/2025/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3420000.zip"
$zipFile = "$env:TEMP\sqlite-tools.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $zipUrl -OutFile $zipFile
Expand-Archive -Path $zipFile -DestinationPath $dest -Force

# Add to PATH for current session
$env:Path = "$dest;$env:Path"
sqlite3 --version
```

2) Create a local DB from the dump and save schema listing:

```powershell
$dump = "$PWD\_backup_database\database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql"
$db = "$PWD\prod_copy.db"
if (Test-Path $db) { Remove-Item $db }
sqlite3 $db ".read '$dump'"
sqlite3 $db ".tables" > tables.txt
Get-Content tables.txt | Select-Object -First 200
```

3) Discovery queries (save outputs):

```powershell
# artwork CREATE statement (if exists)
sqlite3 $db "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' AND lower(name)='artwork' LIMIT 1;" > artwork_create.sql

# artwork columns
sqlite3 $db "PRAGMA table_info('artwork');" > artwork_columns.txt

# artworks with non-empty tags
sqlite3 $db "SELECT count(*) FROM artwork WHERE tags IS NOT NULL AND trim(tags) != '';" > artwork_with_tags_count.txt

# artworks whose tags text contains 'artist' (quick text search)
sqlite3 $db "SELECT count(*) FROM artwork WHERE tags LIKE '%artist%';" > artwork_tags_containing_artist_count.txt

# sample rows (id, first 200 chars of tags) where tags mention artist
sqlite3 $db "SELECT id, substr(tags,1,200) FROM artwork WHERE tags LIKE '%artist%' LIMIT 50;" > artwork_artist_samples.txt

# count artworks with JSON key artist_ids
sqlite3 $db "SELECT count(*) FROM artwork WHERE json_extract(tags, '$.artist_ids') IS NOT NULL;" > artwork_has_artist_ids_count.txt
sqlite3 $db "SELECT id, json_extract(tags, '$.artist_ids') FROM artwork WHERE json_extract(tags, '$.artist_ids') IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50;" > artwork_artist_ids_samples.txt
```

Notes:
- The official sqlite3 builds include the JSON1 extension required for `json_extract` and `json_each`. If `json_extract` errors, your sqlite build may not include JSON1.
- If the `artwork` table is missing, check `tables.txt` and the migration SQL files in `src/workers/migrations` to determine where artwork rows live in this dump.

## Example quick checks to run after discovery

- Open `artwork_columns.txt` to confirm the presence of `tags` and `artist` columns.
- Inspect `artwork_artist_samples.txt` to verify how `artist_name` and `artist_ids` are represented in the `tags` JSON (this is critical to tune the extraction SQL).

## Next steps (after you run discovery)

1. Paste or attach up to ~200 lines from `artwork_artist_samples.txt` and `artwork_artist_ids_samples.txt` here; I will use them to craft exact extraction SQL and a small Node script to populate `artist_id_link_updates`.
2. I will create `scripts/parse-artist-ids.js` (Node) that reads `prod_copy.db`, splits CSV `artist_ids`, looks up matching `artists` by numeric id in `artists.tags` or `artist_id` column, and populates `artist_id_link_updates` with deterministic choice rules.
3. After audit review, we'll run the transactional SQL to insert into `artwork_artists` (if desired) and update `artworks.artist`, then export audit CSV.

## Progress update — work completed in this session

Summary
- I ran a safe, auditable discovery and partial remediation workflow on a local copy of the production dump (`_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql`).
- I implemented extraction, matching, and idempotent linking into the normalized join table rather than trying to write a denormalized `artworks.artist` column directly (the production schema uses a normalized `artwork` table and `artwork_artists` join table).

Key artifacts produced
- Local DB copy used for discovery: `reports/discovery/prod_copy.db` (created from the production SQL dump).
- Audit table in the discovery DB: `artist_name_updates` (populated with extracted artist names and matching metadata).
- CSV exports for review:
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates.csv` — original audit export (audit candidates).
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_updated.csv` — audit export after improved matching (matched artist ids populated where possible).
   - `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` — exported rows that were inserted into `artwork_artists` by the safe linking script.
- SQL scripts added/updated (under `scripts/sql/`):
   - `populate_artist_name_audit.sql` — robust extraction (guards with `json_valid()` and parses multiple tag shapes).
   - `improve_artist_matching.sql` — conservative matching strategies (exact case-insensitive, alias/JSON alias matching, and unique LIKE fallback) to fill `matched_artist_id` on audit rows.
   - `link_artists_to_artworks.sql` — idempotent insertion into `artwork_artists` from audit matches and export of recently-inserted rows.
- Migration scaffold added: `src/workers/migrations/0031_link_artists_from_audit.sql` — idempotent migration that inserts missing `artwork_artists` links and records actions in `artist_linking_audit`.

Results and counts (discovery DB)
- Total audit candidates inserted into `artist_name_updates`: 805 rows.
- Rows with `matched_artist_id` after improved matching: 664 rows.
- Rows inserted into `artwork_artists` (total post-run): 799 rows.
- Rows recorded in `artist_linking_audit` (from migration): 664 rows.

Notes on issues encountered and decisions
- The production dump schema uses `artwork` (singular) — there is no `artist` column on that table. Attempts to update a nonexistent `artworks.artist` column failed; I therefore used the normalized `artwork_artists` join table for linking.
- `tags` values in many rows were malformed or not valid JSON. Extraction SQL was hardened with `json_valid()` checks and fallbacks to avoid errors and false extractions.
- Early linking SQL attempted to select a non-existent `id` column from `artwork_artists` and caused a prepare error; the selection was fixed and the script re-run.

Commands and reproducible steps used (run from repo root)

1) Create local DB from dump

```bash
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read '_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql'"
```

2) Populate the audit (example using the provided SQL)

```bash
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read 'scripts/sql/populate_artist_name_audit.sql'"
```

3) Improve matching (fills `matched_artist_id` on audit rows)

```bash
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read 'scripts/sql/improve_artist_matching.sql'"
```

4) Export audit for review

```bash
sqlite3 -header -csv reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT * FROM artist_name_updates;" > reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_updated.csv
```

5) Link matches into the normalized join table (idempotent)

```bash
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db ".read 'scripts/sql/link_artists_to_artworks.sql'"
sqlite3 -header -csv reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT * FROM artist_linking_audit;" > reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv
```

6) Quick counts

```bash
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist_name_updates;"
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist_name_updates WHERE matched_artist_id IS NOT NULL;"
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artwork_artists;"
sqlite3 reports/discovery/prod_copy.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist_linking_audit;"
```

Where I validated results I used simple spot-check queries and exported small samples for manual inspection.

---

## What remains / next steps

1) Human review of audit CSVs (high priority)
- Files to review:
   - `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_updated.csv` — review extracted artist names, matched artist ids, and spot-check artwork pages in the front-end or raw DB to ensure correctness.
   - `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` — verify the proposed join rows are correct and there are no obvious false positives.

Review checklist
- Confirm that `extracted_artist` values are correct and not empty/whitespace.
- Confirm that `matched_artist_id` corresponds to the intended `artists.id` (check `artists.name`).
- Look for edge cases: multi-artist strings, ambiguous matches, or artist names that map to multiple DB records.
- Sample at least 20 rows randomly and 20 rows from rows where matching used the conservative LIKE fallback.

2) Finalize migration PR (after review)
- Create a PR adding `src/workers/migrations/0031_link_artists_from_audit.sql` (already created in the repo) with a clear description, the rollback SQL snippet, and testing notes.
- Include the CSV artifacts as attachments (or reference to `reports/discovery/`) so reviewers can audit before the migration is applied.

3) Production run options (pick one)
- Option A — Migration: run the migration via the project's migration tooling (`npm run database:migration:prod`) with `CI=true` and monitor. This will apply the idempotent join inserts and record audit rows in `artist_linking_audit`.
- Option B — Database replacement: apply the SQL to a dumped DB locally, build a new DB file, test, and swap the production DB file. This is riskier but acceptable in pre-release contexts. The migration approach is preferred for traceability.

4) Optional: conservative fuzzy matching pass
- There's a remaining set of ~140 unmatched audit rows. If you want to increase coverage, we can add a more aggressive matching pass (normalize diacritics, punctuation, remove honorifics, and use trigram or Levenshtein distance). I recommend exporting those unmatched rows to CSV and reviewing them before running automated fuzzy matching. Any aggressive matching must be validated manually to avoid false positives.

## Handoff to the next developer (quick checklist)

What I did (TL;DR)
- Created a local discovery DB from `_backup_database/database_production_2025-10-07_0439.sql` at `reports/discovery/prod_copy.db`.
- Populated an audit table `artist_name_updates` with extracted artist names from `tags` (scripts/sql/populate_artist_name_audit.sql).
- Implemented and ran improved matching logic (`scripts/sql/improve_artist_matching.sql`) to populate `matched_artist_id` where safe.
- Inserted idempotent join rows into `artwork_artists` using `scripts/sql/link_artists_to_artworks.sql` and recorded operations in `artist_linking_audit` via migration `src/workers/migrations/0031_link_artists_from_audit.sql`.

Files and artifacts to review
- `reports/discovery/prod_copy.db` — local DB snapshot used for discovery.
- `reports/discovery/artist_name_updates_updated.csv` — audit CSV after matching.
- `reports/discovery/artwork_artist_linking.csv` — CSV of inserted link rows.
- `scripts/sql/*.sql` — SQL scripts used for extraction, matching, and linking.
- `src/workers/migrations/0031_link_artists_from_audit.sql` — migration to run in production if approved.

How to validate locally (quick)
1. Open `reports/discovery/prod_copy.db` with `sqlite3` or a SQLite GUI (DB Browser for SQLite).
2. Run the spot-check queries in the Commands and reproducible steps section above.
3. Cross-reference `artists` table for `matched_artist_id` values:

```sql
SELECT u.artwork_id, u.extracted_artist, u.matched_artist_id, a.name
FROM artist_name_updates u
LEFT JOIN artists a ON a.id = u.matched_artist_id
LIMIT 50;
```

4. When ready, apply migration in a staging environment first and monitor logs and front-end rendering.

Communication for reviewers
- Share the `reports/discovery/*.csv` files with product owners or data stewards for sign-off.
- Include the migration PR link and request a careful code review focusing on the matching SQL and idempotency.

Rollback plan
- If problems are observed after migration, run the rollback using `artist_linking_audit` (migration includes a `old_artist` column and timestamp). You can restore original `artworks.artist` values from the audit table or remove inserted `artwork_artists` rows using the recorded audit rows. The migration file contains the rollback helper snippet.

Questions / decision points for the reviewer
- Do you want to proceed with the migration (Option A) or prefer database replacement (Option B)?
- Are you comfortable with the current conservative matching coverage (664/805) or should I implement an additional fuzzy match pass before migrating?

---

If you want, I can now:

- Attach the CSVs to a new pull request and include a short PR description and reviewers.
- Create the small Node script to parse `artist_ids` (the second milestone in the original plan) and run it on `prod_copy.db` to resolve records that include `artist_ids` in tags.

Marking this document updated and ready for review.
