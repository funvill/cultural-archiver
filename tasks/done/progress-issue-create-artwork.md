# Progress: Fix Artwork Creation Issue

**Date**: September 14, 2025  
**Issue**: Server error when submitting new artwork - "no such table: logbook"  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Problem Analysis

### Current Error

```
Error: D1_ERROR: no such table: logbook: SQLITE_ERROR
at DatabaseService.updateLogbookPhotos (file:///C:/Users/funvill/Documents/git/cultural-archiver/src/workers/lib/database.ts:333:5)
```

### Root Cause

The code is trying to update a `logbook` table that doesn't exist in the current database schema. According to the database documentation, the system was refactored to use a unified `submissions` table instead of separate `logbook` and `artwork` tables.

### Current Database Schema

- ✅ `submissions` table exists (unified submission system)
- ❌ `logbook` table does NOT exist (legacy table removed during refactoring)

## Tasks Progress

- [x] 1. Identify all references to `logbook` table in database.ts
- [x] 2. Fix `updateLogbookPhotos` method to use `submissions` table
- [x] 3. Fix `linkLogbookToArtwork` method to use `submissions` table
- [x] 4. Fix `updateLogbookStatus` method to use `submissions` table
- [x] 5. Fix all queries using `'logbook'` to use `'logbook_entry'` submission type
- [x] 6. Test the fix with server restart ✅
- [x] 7. Test artwork submission with Playwright ✅

## ✅ SOLUTION SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED

The artwork submission functionality is now fully working!

### Test Results ✅

- **Photo upload**: SUCCESS - File processed and displayed
- **Location extraction**: SUCCESS - EXIF coordinates extracted (49.256767, -123.081119)
- **Form submission**: SUCCESS - All fields accepted
- **Database insertion**: SUCCESS - No more "logbook table" errors
- **HTTP Response**: **201 Created**
- **UI Feedback**: **"Artwork submitted successfully!"**
- **Server logs**: Clean, no errors during submission process

### Resolution Summary

The issue was caused by multiple database methods still referencing the old `logbook` table that was removed during schema refactoring. Fixed by updating all queries to use the unified `submissions` table with proper `logbook_entry` submission type filtering.

## Fixed Methods

- `updateLogbookPhotos()` - Updated to use `submissions` table with `logbook_entry` filter
- `linkLogbookToArtwork()` - Updated to use `submissions` table with `logbook_entry` filter
- `updateLogbookStatus()` - Updated to use `submissions` table with `logbook_entry` filter
- All query methods - Fixed `submission_type = 'logbook'` to `'logbook_entry'`

## Files to Modify

- `src/workers/lib/database.ts` - Fix `updateLogbookPhotos` method

## Next Steps

1. Search for all `logbook` table references
2. Update code to use `submissions` table instead
3. Test the fix
