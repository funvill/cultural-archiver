# Map Preview Fix - Final Summary

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Branch**: map  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Verified

## Problem Statement

The map preview card was showing "Untitled Artwork" instead of displaying the actual artwork title, artist name, and type when users clicked on map markers or when previews were shown programmatically.

## Root Cause

The map preview flow had two issues:

1. **MapComponent** was emitting shallow preview data from the pin object (which only contained basic lat/lon/id data) without fetching full artwork details
2. **MapView** was not enriching the preview with complete artwork information from the artworks store

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

#### 1. MapComponent.vue Enhancement
- Modified `onWebGLMarkerClick` handler to fetch full artwork details via `artworksStore.fetchArtwork(markerId)` before emitting the preview
- Enriched preview payload now includes:
  - `title` from artwork details
  - `artistName` from artwork details  
  - `type_name` from artwork details
  - `thumbnailUrl` extracted defensively from photos array
  - Fallback to pin data if fetch fails

#### 2. MapView.vue Enhancement (Secondary Enrichment)
- Kept existing async enrichment path as a safety net
- Quick preview shown immediately, then updated with full details
- Ensures smooth UX with progressive enhancement

#### 3. Type System Update
- Extended `MapPreview` interface in `src/frontend/src/types/index.ts` to include `type_name?: string`
- Ensures type safety throughout the preview pipeline

### Test Helpers Added

For testing and debugging, two browser helpers are now available:

```javascript
// Manually show a preview (testing MapView path)
window.__ca_test_show_preview({ 
  id: 'artwork-id', 
  title: 'Title', 
  description: 'Description',
  type_name: 'Type',
  lat: 49.277, 
  lon: -123.104 
})

// Simulate marker click (testing MapComponent path)
window.__ca_test_trigger_marker_click('artwork-id')
```

## Verification

### Playwright MCP Testing

Comprehensive manual testing performed using Playwright MCP browser automation:

**Test Artwork**: East Van Cross (ID: `428632b2-d68b-47e4-99d9-a841580ce071`)

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Title displayed: "East Van Cross"
- ✅ Type displayed: "Sculpture"
- ✅ Artist displayed: "Ken Lum"
- ✅ Marker click triggers API fetch and enrichment
- ✅ MapView enrichment path works correctly
- ✅ No "Untitled Artwork" fallback shown

**Evidence**: 
- Console logs showing API fetch: `/api/artworks/428632b2-d68b-47e4-99d9-a841580ce071`
- Screenshots saved in `.playwright-mcp/` directory
- Full test report: `tasks/playwright-mcp-test-results.md`

### Build Verification

- ✅ Frontend type-check passed: `vue-tsc --noEmit`
- ✅ Full build completed: `npm run build`
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No compilation warnings

## Files Modified

```
src/frontend/src/components/MapComponent.vue    - Marker click enrichment
src/frontend/src/views/MapView.vue              - Preview rendering & secondary enrichment
src/frontend/src/types/index.ts                 - MapPreview type extension
```

## Files Created

```
tasks/playwright-mcp-test-results.md            - Detailed test report
tasks/progress-map-artwork-title.md             - Progress/handoff document
tasks/map-preview-fix-summary.md                - This summary
.playwright-mcp/map-preview-east-van-cross.png  - Screenshot: initial preview
.playwright-mcp/map-preview-east-van-cross-enriched.png - Screenshot: enriched preview
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: `artworksStore.fetchArtwork()` uses session cache, so repeated clicks don't cause duplicate API calls
- **UX**: Quick preview shown immediately, enriched preview updates smoothly without flash
- **API Load**: Minimal impact as fetches are cached and only triggered on user interaction

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Pre-fetch Strategy**: Pre-load artwork details for visible map markers to make previews instant
2. **Automated E2E Tests**: Convert Playwright MCP manual tests into automated CI/CD suite
3. **Thumbnail Optimization**: Further optimize thumbnail extraction logic for edge cases

## Deployment Notes

- ✅ Ready for production deployment
- ✅ No database changes required
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data

## How to Test Locally

```powershell
# Start dev server
cd src/frontend
npm run dev

# In browser, navigate to http://localhost:5173/
# Open browser devtools console and run:
window.__ca_test_show_preview({ 
  id: '428632b2-d68b-47e4-99d9-a841580ce071', 
  title: 'East Van Cross', 
  description: 'Sculpture',
  type_name: 'Sculpture',
  lat: 49.277, 
  lon: -123.104 
})

# Or test marker click:
window.__ca_test_trigger_marker_click('428632b2-d68b-47e4-99d9-a841580ce071')
```

Expected result: Preview card shows "East Van Cross", type "Sculpture", artist "Ken Lum"

## Conclusion

✅ **Issue Resolved**: Map preview cards now display complete artwork information including title, artist, and type instead of showing "Untitled Artwork".

✅ **Tested**: Verified with Playwright MCP interactive testing in live environment.

✅ **Production Ready**: All code changes compiled successfully, type-safe, and ready for deployment.
