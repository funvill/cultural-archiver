## What inspired you to start Public Art Registry? 

I wanted to solve two questions. What art am I looking at? and what art is nearby? I often found when traveling that I found some interesting public art, but no plague or sign describing the artwork. I didn't know who made it, why they made it, what was their motivation and no way of finding answers to these questions. When I walking around the city and had some spare time. I would often look for art nearby, but it was a random chance that I would run into anything. I looked for maps of art in the area and didn't find a good map. Art was not discoverable. 

## Was there a specific artwork or moment where you thought, “This needs to be preserved”? 

The Vancouver mural festival website was taken down after the festival closed down in 2025. The history of all the write ups on the murals across the city that had been painted in the last 10 years gone. That history gone. A lost for "the commons" the word was a worse place when that data disappeared. I said that something needed to be done about it ! 

## Why is public art worth preserving? 

Culture, so much of art disappears to the passage of time. 

## What risks do you see if nobody documents it? 

Humans creativity disappears, no one can learn from it. We can't get better unless we learn from our history. Art is part of culture who we are at the time we created it. 

## What is the core mission of the project in your own words? 

Document public artworks for future generations. Give back to "the commons" to make the world a better place. 

## Do you see this more as a community archive, a game-like discovery tool, or both? 

A community archive, the game-like discovery tools are just there to help incentivize people to participate. The goal is to make the archive. the game is to get people to help fill out the archive. 

## What’s your long-term vision for this project? 

It becomes the default location for people to answer the same questions that I had when I started this project. What am I looking at, where can i find more art? I would love this to be useful to research projects and archivists. 

## What does it mean to you when someone takes a photo, visits a piece, or updates an artist’s info? 

They are giving back to the community that they are a part of. They are making the world a better place, they are participating and helping their fellow man. The world gets better because of their actions. It means that this system is working, that I helped someone, I gave them the tools to make this world a better place. 

## How do you hope future generations will use or experience Public Art Registry? 

I hope it becomes their main research point for making new art. A place of inspiration for creating new art. 

## Do you want to include yourself (e.g., “Founded by Steven Smethurst”) or keep it focused on the collective community? 

include myself 

## Should the About page highlight your personal journey, or stay more impersonal and project-focused? 

Lets make two pages. The personal journey for the blog post on launch and the about page impersonal and project-focused


## You mentioned the commons — how do you personally define that, and why does it matter to you? 

So much of the world is built around taking from the common good, making it private and selling access to it. I hate that. We should be adding to the common good for everyone's access. in order to make the world a better place. The commons euphuizes this. The value that the world gets from Wikipedia is unmeasurable. I hope this website can be the Wikipedia for art. Do some good for the world. 

## How does Creative Commons licensing (or open access in general) play into your vision for this project? 

I want the content that is given to this project by its users to be able to be used by other services like Wikipedia and Open Source Maps. A permissive license allows for that to happen. This also means that I don't own the content the commons does. This means that anyone can do anything they want with content. 

## Do you see this project more as preservation of history or inspiration for the future — or equally both? 

Primary the preservation of history. But I hope that it will inspire future generations 

## What role does the community play compared to you as the founder? 

I saw a need for this website to exist, and I made it. I want to pass the project on to people who can carry it forward and keep it going after I am gone. A strong community is a must for this project to keep it going long after I am gone. 

## How has working on this project changed the way you see cities, travel, or daily life? 

I knew that there was a lot of art in Vancouver, BC. But I never knew how much until I started collecting it. I thought that there would be a max of 300 public artworks but there are thousands scattered across every neighborhood of Vancouver. Now that I am looking for art, i see it everywhere , on every street. 

## Do you think of yourself as more of an “artist,” “archivist,” or “builder of tools for others”?

Builder of tools ## Beyond being a database, what do you want Public Art Registry to inspire people to do? Go see more art, fall in love with art, be passionate about things, participate in life 

## Do you see collaborations in the future — with schools, museums, city planners, or artists themselves? 

Yes, I am hopeful that I can expand this tool to work for as many different groups as possible to help them in their goals 

## If someone came back and looked at this project 50 years from now, what would you hope they see?

 A good history of culture though the ages. Millions of artworks and artists who gave the world a little bit of their creative self for the world to see.
