# Issue: Artists Not Appearing After Mass Import

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority:** High

## ‚úÖ Resolution Summary

**ROOT CAUSE:** Database schema CHECK constraint mismatch with application code.

**The Problem:**
- Database schema defined: `status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')`
- Application code was using: `status = 'active'`
- Result: SQLite silently rejected INSERT statements with invalid status values

**The Fix:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `createArtistFromMassImport()` in `src/workers/lib/database.ts` to use `'approved'`
2. ‚úÖ Updated `getArtistsList()` in `src/workers/routes/artists.ts` to filter by `'approved'`
3. ‚úÖ Updated TypeScript types to match schema: `'approved' | 'pending' | 'rejected'`
4. ‚úÖ Updated test expectations to use `'approved'` instead of `'active'`

**Test Results:** ‚úÖ All 658 tests passing (1 skipped)

**Verification (2025-10-04T02:10Z):**
- ‚úÖ Backend API: `http://localhost:8787/api/artists` returns 15 artists with 'approved' status
- ‚úÖ Proxied API: `http://localhost:5173/api/artists` returns same data (Vite proxy working)
- ‚úÖ Test case artist "Nuburi Toko" successfully appears in API response
- ‚úÖ Frontend route exists and is configured correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Frontend may require hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached JavaScript

**Deployment:** Ready for production - artists now appear in the index after mass-import

---

## Problem Statement

Artists are being created during mass-import operations but are not appearing on the artist index page (`http://localhost:5173/artists`).

## Import Test Results

**Command:**
```bash
node dist/cli/cli-entry.js import --importer osm-artwork --generate-report \
  --input C:\Users\funvill\Documents\git\cultural-archiver\src\lib\data-collection\osm\output\merged\merged-artworks.geojson \
  --output processed-art.json --exporter api --config api-config-dev.json \
  --limit 10 --offset 10
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Successful: 9
- ‚ùå Failed: 0
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped: 0
- üîÑ Duplicates: 1
- üìä Total Processed: 10
- ‚è±Ô∏è Processing Time: 445ms
- üìà Success Rate: 90.0%

**Expected Artist:**
- Example: "Nuburi Toko" from artwork `c1ed6c1a-88c8-4f86-8aa3-cc9f320d743c`
- Should appear at: `http://localhost:5173/artists`

## Investigation Progress

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Artist Profile Query (2025-10-03)

**Issue Found:** The `GET /api/artists/:id` endpoint was using the deprecated `artist_names` field.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `src/workers/routes/artists.ts` line 177-183 to use `artwork_artists` junction table.

**Before:**
```typescript
WHERE artist_names LIKE '%"' || ? || '"%' AND a.status = 'approved'
```

**After:**
```typescript
INNER JOIN artwork_artists aa ON a.id = aa.artwork_id
WHERE aa.artist_id = ? AND a.status = 'approved'
```

**Test Results:** ‚úÖ All 658 tests pass (1 skipped)

### üîç Current Investigation

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** Status field mismatch between schema and code!

**The Problem:**
- Database schema CHECK constraint: `status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')`
- Artist creation code was using: `status = 'active'`
- Artist index query was filtering: `status = 'active'`

**Result:** Artists were being rejected by the database constraint, so NO records were actually created!

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `createArtistFromMassImport()` to use `status = 'approved'`
2. ‚úÖ Updated `getArtistsList()` to filter by `status = 'approved'` (default)
3. ‚úÖ Updated TypeScript types to use `'approved' | 'pending' | 'rejected'`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/workers/lib/database.ts` - Line 651: Changed 'active' to 'approved'
- `src/workers/routes/artists.ts` - Line 43-47: Changed status type and default

**Next Steps:**
1. Check artist status field in database (should be 'active' for index)
2. Verify artist records are actually being created in the database
3. Check if frontend is correctly calling the `/api/artists` endpoint
4. Verify the `GET /api/artists` query filters and status checks

## Database Schema Reference

### Artists Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE artists (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  aliases TEXT,
  tags TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### Artwork_Artists Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE artwork_artists (
  artwork_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  artist_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'primary',
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  PRIMARY KEY (artwork_id, artist_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (artwork_id) REFERENCES artwork(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Relevant Code Paths

### Backend
- `src/workers/routes/mass-import.ts` - Artist creation during import
- `src/workers/routes/artists.ts` - Artist index and profile endpoints
- `src/workers/lib/database.ts` - `createArtistFromMassImport()` method
- `src/workers/lib/artist-matching.ts` - Artist matching and creation logic

### Frontend
- Frontend route for `/artists` page
- API service calling `/api/artists`

## Questions to Answer

1. ‚úÖ Are artists being created in the database?
2. ‚ùì What status are artists created with (`pending` vs `active`)?
3. ‚ùì Does the artist index filter by status?
4. ‚ùì Is the frontend correctly calling the backend API?
5. ‚ùì Are there any CORS or network issues preventing the data from loading?

## Expected Behavior

When mass-import creates an artist:
1. Artist record created in `artists` table with `status = 'active'`
2. Artwork-Artist link created in `artwork_artists` table
3. Artist appears in `GET /api/artists` response
4. Frontend displays artist in the artist index page

## Logs & Debug Output

### Mass Import Artist Debug Logs
```
[MASS_IMPORT_ARTIST_DEBUG] ===== ARTIST PROCESSING START =====
[MASS_IMPORT_ARTIST_DEBUG] Looking for artist: "Artist Name"
[MASS_IMPORT_ARTIST_DEBUG] CREATED new artist: {artist_id}
[MASS_IMPORT_ARTIST_DEBUG] ===== ARTIST PROCESSING END =====
```

### Artist Creation Debug Logs
```
[ARTIST_CREATION_DEBUG] Creating artist from Vancouver data for: "Artist Name"
[ARTIST_CREATION_DEBUG] Successfully created artist with ID: {artist_id}
[DB] Created artist for mass import: {artist_id} - {artist_name}
```

## Resolution Plan

- [ ] Check artist status field default value
- [ ] Verify artist index query status filter
- [ ] Test direct database query for created artists
- [ ] Verify frontend API integration
- [ ] Update artist creation to use correct status

## Notes

- The database schema was recently updated to use `artwork_artists` junction table
- Some code still references the old `artist_names` field (needs cleanup)
- Artist status field uses 'active'/'inactive' but schema shows 'pending'/'approved'/'rejected'
