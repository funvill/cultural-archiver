# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Artwork Details Page Redesign

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature aims to redesign the artwork details page to improve the visual impact and accessibility of key information for general public and art enthusiasts. The main image carousel will be moved to the top of the page and displayed full width (edge-to-edge). Below the image, the title and artist will be shown, followed by basic stats about the artwork (date created, location, and tags/categories). The description/notes section will remain in its current position. The redesign will use the existing site style and must be mobile responsive.

## 2. Goals

- Increase the visual prominence of the artwork image.
- Make key information (title, artist, stats) more accessible and easy to find.
- Maintain a clean, modern, and mobile-responsive layout.

## 3. User Stories

- As a visitor, I want to see the artwork image prominently at the top so I can appreciate the art immediately.
- As a visitor, I want to quickly find the title, artist, and basic stats about the artwork without scrolling past other content.
- As a visitor, I want the page to look good and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The main image carousel must be positioned at the very top of the artwork details page.
2. The image carousel must be displayed full width (edge-to-edge) on all devices.
3. The title and artist must be displayed directly below the image carousel.
4. Basic stats (date created, location, tags/categories) must be displayed below the title and artist.
5. The description/notes section must remain in its current position (not moved above the image or stats).
6. The page layout must be mobile responsive.
7. The redesign must use the existing site style and components.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Changing the position of the description/notes section.
- Modifying the map location or other unrelated page elements.
- Adding new stats beyond date created, location, and tags/categories.
- Introducing new design systems or external UI frameworks.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- Follow the current siteâ€™s style guide and component library.
- Ensure the image carousel is visually prominent and edge-to-edge.
- Maintain clear separation between image, title/artist, and stats sections.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Ensure the carousel component supports full-width display and is responsive.
- Use existing data fields for date created, location, and tags/categories.
- No changes to backend API or database schema are required for this redesign.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Increased average time spent on artwork details pages.
- Positive user feedback regarding the new layout.
- No increase in support requests related to artwork details page usability.
- Page remains fully functional and visually appealing on mobile devices.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the location be displayed as text, a map, or both?
- Are there any analytics to track user engagement with the new layout?
