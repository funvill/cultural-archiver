Edit pages

Goal:

The edit page allows users to edit the artwork details like a wiki. This allows users to add or change information about an artwork.

Notes:

- From the edit page they should be able to edit the title, description, artist, keywords.
- The tags/fields such as artwork_type, will be edited from their own edit tags page.
- In the edit page, the description field needs to be 4x the current height.
- The artist for a artwork is unique as it is a lookup into the artist table. Many to Many, An artwork can have many artist. Artists can have many artworks. There should be a seach bar that users can use to search for artists, then add them to the artwork, then the existing artists on the artwork should have a little "X" next to their name to remove them from the artwork. Have the ability to add new artists.
- If an artwork does not have a artist associated with it, then show "Unknown artist"
- The edit page should show the photos, but not allow them to be altered or added to.
- While the keywords are part of the tags system, they should also show on the edit page. Comma seperated.

Create a new page specificly for editing tags of an artwork or artist page. Add a "edit" button to the "Information & Details", that opens this editing tags page.
