# Product Requirements Document: Frontend Screens (Vue + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements the complete user-facing interface for the Cultural
Archiver MVP, providing a mobile-first web application for discovering,
submitting, and managing public art submissions. The frontend enables users to
view approved artworks on an interactive map, submit new artwork with photos and
metadata, view detailed artwork information, and manage their submission
history. The interface prioritizes simplicity and speed, targeting a 60-second
happy path for new submissions while maintaining WCAG AA accessibility
standards.

## Goals

1. Enable users to discover approved public artworks within 500m of their
   location via an interactive map
2. Provide a streamlined submission workflow for new artwork with photo uploads
   and optional metadata
3. Allow users to add logbook entries to existing artworks with photos and notes
4. Implement a simple reviewer interface for content moderation (approve/reject
   workflow)
5. Maintain mobile-first responsive design that works on 90% mobile usage
6. Achieve sub-60 second submission workflow for the happy path
7. Meet WCAG AA accessibility standards for keyboard navigation and color
   contrast

## Design Considerations

- **Framework**: Vue 3 with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for consistent design
  system
- **Map**: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles for reliable mapping functionality
- **Mobile-First**: Design and test on mobile devices first, scale up for larger
  screens
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Load core functionality first, enhance with
  additional features
- **Component Architecture**: Create reusable components for artwork cards,
  photo galleries, and form elements
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators for all async
  operations
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to prevent complete app
  crashes

## Technical Considerations

- **API Integration**: Interface with existing Cloudflare Workers API endpoints
- **Photo Handling**: Implement client-side photo resizing to 800px before
  upload
- **State Management**: Use Vue 3 composition API for local state, consider
  Pinia for global state if needed
- **Routing**: Implement Vue Router for navigation between pages
- **Location Services**: Integrate with browser geolocation API with appropriate
  fallbacks
- **File Uploads**: Handle photo uploads with progress indicators and error
  handling
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for images and optimize bundle size
- **Security**: Sanitize user inputs and implement proper content security
  policies

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: 90% of users complete submission workflow within 60
  seconds
- **Mobile Usage**: Interface works correctly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Accessibility**: Pass automated WCAG AA compliance testing
- **Error Rates**: Less than 5% of submissions fail due to frontend errors
- **Load Performance**: Initial page load under 3 seconds on mobile networks
- **User Completion**: 80% of users who start submission process complete it
  successfully
- **Reviewer Efficiency**: Reviewers can process submissions 50% faster than
  manual processes

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement basic analytics tracking for user interactions to inform
   future improvements?
2. Do we need specific error tracking integration (e.g., Sentry) for production
   monitoring?
3. Should the consent modal include links to legal documents hosted elsewhere or
   embedded text?
4. What specific automated tests should be prioritized for the critical path
   testing requirement?
5. Should we implement any client-side caching for artwork data to improve
   performance on repeat visits?

  dependency
