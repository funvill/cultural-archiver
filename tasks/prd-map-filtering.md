## 1. Problem Statement & Goal

**Problem:** The main map can become cluttered with a large number of artwork markers, making it difficult for users to find artworks that are relevant to their immediate goals, such as visiting new places or focusing on a specific curated list.

**Goal:** Give users a simple and intuitive way to filter the artworks shown on the map. This will reduce visual noise and allow them to focus on a targeted set of locations based on their saved lists and viewing history.

## 2. User Stories

1. **Finding New Artworks:** As a user who has seen several artworks in an area, I want to filter the map to show only artworks I have *not* yet seen, so I can easily discover new places to visit.
2. **Planning an Outing:** As a user who has curated a "Want to See" list, I want to filter the map to show only markers from that list, so I can plan my route efficiently.
3. **Focused Exploration:** As a user with a specific list for an upcoming trip (e.g., "New York Art"), I want to filter the map to show only items from that list that I have also not yet seen, so I can maximize my time visiting new art.

## 3. Feature Requirements

### 3.1. Access & UI

- **Entry Point:** The filtering options will be accessed via an icon within the map's main navigation bar.
- **Screen Layout:** The "Map Options" screen will be presented as a full-screen overlay on all devices.
- **Filter Controls:** All filters will be enabled or disabled using standard toggle switches for a clear on/off state.
- **Default State:** When the filter screen is opened and no filters are active, it will display all available filters in their "off" state.
- **Resetting Filters:** A "Reset Filters" button will be available on the filter options screen. When pressed, it will turn off all active filters and return the map to its default state.

### üìã **Critical Issues to Resolve:**

**Priority 1 - Core Functionality:**
1. **Priority-Based Icons**: Implement flag/star/question mark icons per PRD specification 
2. **Filter Logic Verification**: Ensure OR logic for multiple lists and subtractive logic work correctly

**Priority 2 - UI/UX:**
3. **Modal Scrolling**: Add proper scrolling for long lists of custom filters
4. **Section Organization**: Add "Filters" heading and reorganize documentation placement

**Priority 3 - Advanced Features:**
5. **Performance**: Add caching and optimization for list membership checking
6. **Analytics**: Add usage tracking and filter recommendations

### üéâ **Recently Fixed Issues:**

**‚úÖ Completed in Latest Session:**
1. **Real-time Filter Application**: Fixed Vue reactivity chain - filters now apply immediately
2. **Filter Toggle Event Handlers**: Fixed click handlers to properly bind to Vue event system
3. **Banner Visibility**: "No filters active" banner now properly hidden when no filters are set
4. **Authentication Integration**: User lists now loading and displaying properly for signed-in users
5. **Priority-Based Marker Icons**: Flag/Star/Question icons implemented for system lists and default markers

### üîß **Technical Architecture Implemented:**

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/frontend/src/composables/useMapFilters.ts` - Main filter logic composable (partial)
- `src/frontend/src/components/MapFiltersModal.vue` - Filter modal component (partial)
- `src/frontend/src/views/MapView.vue` - Integration with map view (partial)

**State Management:**
- localStorage keys: `mapFilters:state`, `mapFilters:analytics`
- Basic state persistence working
- Filter state structure defined but not fully functional

**API Integration:**
- Placeholder for `getUserLists()` API integration
- Authentication flow detection implemented
- User list loading logic exists but not working

### üéØ **Next Developer Tasks:**

1. **Implement Priority Icons**: Add flag/star/question mark icon system in MapComponent
2. **Verify Filter Logic**: Test OR/AND logic works correctly when multiple filters are applied
3. **Fix Modal Scrolling**: Add proper CSS overflow handling for filter lists
4. **Add Missing Sections**: Include "Filters" heading and reorganize documentation placement
5. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching for list membership checking
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive filter combination testing

### üìä **Testing Status:**
- Frontend tests: 486/487 passing (99.8% success rate)  
- TypeScript compilation: Successful with zero errors
- Manual testing: Core functionality not working as expected
- Cross-browser testing: Not completed

### 3.2. Filter Definitions

A new "Filters" section will be added to the map options. The following filters will be available:

- **Want to See:** When enabled, only shows artworks from the user's "Want to See" system list.
- **User Lists:** Displays a scrolling list of the user's custom-created lists. Each list has a toggle switch.
  - If a user has no custom lists, this section will display a message like: "You haven't created any lists yet."
  - The lists will be ordered by the most recently updated.
- **Not Seen by Me:** This is a **subtractive filter**. When enabled, it removes any artworks that are in the user's "Been Here" or "Logged" system lists from the final filtered result set.

### 3.3. Filter Logic

- **Combining Filters:** When multiple filters (e.g., "Want to See" and a custom "New York" list) are enabled, the logic is **additive (OR)**. The map will show markers that are in *either* of the selected lists.
- **"Not Seen by Me" Interaction:** This filter is always applied last. It removes items from the set created by any other active filters. For example, if "Want to See" is active, enabling "Not Seen by Me" will show items that are in "Want to See" AND are NOT in "Been Here" or "Logged".
- **State Persistence:** The user's last-used filter settings will be persisted between sessions.

### 3.4. Active Filter Display

- **Banner:** When one or more filters are active, a banner will appear at the top of the map.
- **Banner Content:** The banner will display a concise summary of the active filters (e.g., "Filters active: Want to See, Not Seen by Me"). For the initial release, this banner will not contain a reset button.

### 3.5. Map Marker & Icon Updates

To support the filtering system, map marker icons will be updated to convey status at a glance.

- **Icon Priority (Initial Release):** If an artwork falls into multiple categories, the icon will be determined by the following priority:
    1. **"Been Here" / "Logged"**: A flag icon inside a gray circle.
    2. **"Want to See"**: A gold star icon in a circle.
    3. **Default**: A question mark icon.
- **"Not Seen by Me" Effect on Icons:** If the "Not Seen by Me" filter is active, artworks in "Been Here" or "Logged" will be completely hidden from the map, not just shown with a different icon.

### 3.6. Scope & Future Enhancements

- **Application Area:** These filters will only apply to the main, full-screen map view.
- **Future - Photo Thumbnails:** In a future iteration, a fourth icon type will be introduced: a circular thumbnail of the artwork's primary photo. This will have a lower priority than the "Been Here" and "Want to See" icons.
- **Future - List Search:** For users with many lists, a search/filter bar for the lists themselves is a potential future enhancement.
- **Future - Banner Reset Button:** A "Reset" button may be added to the active filter banner in a future release for quicker access.

# Implementation Progress & Handover Document

## Project Status: **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**

This document serves as a handover to the next developer. The map filtering feature has been partially implemented with significant architectural groundwork completed, but several critical issues remain unresolved.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Implementation**

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Map Filter Button**: Filter button positioned in map navigation (top-right, above map options)
- [x] **Modal Interface**: Full-screen responsive modal (`MapFiltersModal.vue`) with close functionality
- [x] **Filter Composable**: `useMapFilters.ts` composable with state management and persistence
- [x] **Authentication Flow**: Proper handling for signed-in vs anonymous users
- [x] **State Persistence**: Filter preferences saved in localStorage (`mapFilters:state`)

### UI Components
- [x] **Professional Modal Design**: Click-outside-to-close, proper close icons
- [x] **Responsive Layout**: Works on mobile and desktop
- [x] **Basic Toggle Structure**: Toggle switch framework implemented
- [x] **Documentation Section**: "How Map Filters Work" explanatory content
- [x] **Reset Functionality**: "Reset All Filters" button implemented

- [x] **Component Integration**: Modal integrated with MapView component
- [x] **Error Handling**: Basic error boundaries and loading states
- [x] **Clustering Preservation**: Original clustering functionality maintained

## ‚ùå **Critical Issues Requiring Resolution**

### 1. **Real-Time Filter Application** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Filters do not apply immediately when toggled. Changes only take effect after page refresh.

**Root Cause**: The filter state changes are not properly integrated with the map's artwork display pipeline. The `artworks` computed property in `MapView.vue` needs to consume filtered results from the composable.

**Required Fix**: 
```typescript
// In MapView.vue - artworks computed property needs:
const artworks = computed(() => {
  if (listFilterActive.value && listArtworks.value.length > 0) {
    return listArtworks.value;
  }
  
  const baseArtworks = artworksStore.artworks;
  if (mapFilters.hasActiveFilters.value) {
    return mapFilters.getFilteredArtworks(baseArtworks); // ‚Üê Missing integration
  }
  
  return baseArtworks;
});
```

### 2. **Missing Filter Controls** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: "Not Seen by Me" toggle and custom user list toggles are not visible in the modal.

**Issues Identified**:
- Filter toggles don't render for authenticated users
- User lists not loading/displaying properly
- Authentication state not properly triggering filter visibility

**Required Fix**: Debug the authentication flow and ensure proper rendering of filter controls.

### 3. **Incorrect Marker Icons** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: All map markers show as colored circles instead of the specified priority-based icons.

**Current**: Colored circular markers for all artworks
**Required**: 
1. Flag icon in gray circle for "Been Here"/"Logged" artworks
2. Gold star icon in circle for "Want to See" artworks  
3. Question mark icon for default/unvisited artworks

**Location**: `src/frontend/src/components/MapComponent.vue` - marker creation logic

### 4. **UI/UX Issues** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problems**:
- Modal content doesn't scroll properly with long lists
- Missing "Filters" heading for filter section
- "How Map Filters Work" section positioned incorrectly

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### Files Modified
1. **`src/frontend/src/components/MapFiltersModal.vue`** - Main filter modal component
2. **`src/frontend/src/composables/useMapFilters.ts`** - Filter state management composable  
3. **`src/frontend/src/views/MapView.vue`** - Map view integration
4. **`src/frontend/src/components/MapComponent.vue`** - Map marker rendering (partial)

### Key Components Architecture
- **Filter State**: Managed via `useMapFilters` composable with reactive state
- **Persistence**: localStorage integration for filter preferences
- **API Integration**: Connected to existing `getUserLists()` endpoint
- **Authentication**: Conditional rendering based on user sign-in status

### Filter Logic Specification
- **Additive (OR) Logic**: Multiple list filters show artworks in ANY selected list
- **Subtractive Logic**: "Not Seen by Me" removes visited items from result set
- **Priority System**: Been Here > Want to See > Default for marker display

## üö® **Next Developer Action Items**

### Immediate (Must Fix)
1. **Fix real-time filtering**: Integrate filter results with map artwork display
2. **Debug missing toggles**: Restore "Not Seen by Me" and user list controls
3. **Test authentication flow**: Ensure proper filter visibility for signed-in users

### Secondary
4. **Implement priority icons**: Replace colored circles with flag/star/question icons
5. **Fix modal scrolling**: Enable proper scroll for long filter lists
6. **Reorganize UI sections**: Add "Filters" heading and reposition documentation

### Testing Required
- Manual testing of all filter combinations
- Authentication state testing (signed-in vs anonymous)
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Mobile responsiveness validation

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Debt & Considerations**

### Performance
- Caching system partially implemented but needs optimization
- API call efficiency can be improved with better state management
- Consider implementing debounced filter application

### Code Quality
- TypeScript types need refinement for filter interfaces
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Test coverage needs to be added for filter logic

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Filter presets/saving functionality
- Analytics tracking for filter usage
- Advanced filter combinations
- Export/import filter configurations

## üìù **Development Environment**

### Setup
- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Cloudflare Workers deployment
- Vitest for testing

### Key Dependencies
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Leaflet.js for map rendering
- Existing authentication system
- localStorage for persistence
