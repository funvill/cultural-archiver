## Major tasks

- [x] 1. Discovery and placement
  - [x] 1.1 Identify where `NavigationRail.vue` and `BottomNavigation.vue` live in the codebase
  - [x] 1.2 Confirm how `AppShell.vue` mounts the navigation components and the breakpoint logic
  - Summary: Located components and verified integration with AppShell

- [x] 2. Implement visual parity
  - [x] 2.1 Make the expanded NavigationRail share the same button sizes, shapes, colors, and shadow as the BottomNavigation
  - [x] 2.2 Ensure the FAB appears visually identical (shadow, size, hover, focus) and is present when the rail is expanded
  - [x] 2.3 Align notification badge placement and profile/login button styles
  - [x] 2.4 Replace any placeholder icons with the canonical Heroicons used by BottomNavigation (e.g., `Bars3Icon`, `BellIcon`, `PlusIcon`) and ensure rotations/placements match
  - Summary: Synchronized FAB size (w-14 h-14), unified button styling, and consistent iconography

- [x] 3. Wiring and behavior
  - [x] 3.1 Ensure that toggles (expand/collapse) emit the same events and update `AppShell` state
  - [x] 3.2 Preserve accessibility attributes (aria-labels, focus rings) and keyboard navigation
  - Summary: Added authentication props to BottomNavigation and synchronized event handlers

- [x] 4. Build, test, and verify
  - [x] 4.1 Run `npm run type-check:frontend` and `npm run build:frontend` to validate changes
  - [x] 4.2 Manual visual QA in Chrome/Firefox and responsive widths (mobile and desktop)
  - [x] 4.3 Add Vitest unit tests for: rail expand/collapse state, emitted events, and presence of FAB/button elements
  - Summary: Build successful, all tests pass

- [x] 5. Layout and UX Improvements (NEW - September 24, 2025)
  - [x] 5.1 Fix content push behavior - navigation rail should push main content to the right instead of overlapping it
  - [x] 5.2 Fix z-index layering - navigation rail should appear on top of the bottom menu bar
  - [x] 5.3 Hide hamburger menu icon on large screens where navigation rail is available
  - [x] 5.4 Standardize help icons across all navigation components
  - Summary: Improved desktop navigation UX with proper content layout and consistent iconography

- [x] 6. Handoff notes and staging
  - [x] 6.1 Document any asset changes (logos, icons) and paths
  - [x] 6.2 Note any follow-up items (visual tweaks, animation smoothing)
  - Summary: Navigation rail and bottom navigation now have identical contents with improved desktop layout

## Work completed so far (AI-run edits)

- [X] Located and updated `NavigationRail.vue` to add a left-side rail with expand/collapse behavior.
- [X] Updated `AppShell.vue` to render `NavigationRail` on md+ screens and pass expand state and events.
- [X] Aligned `useBreakpoint.ts` to Tailwind md breakpoint (768px) so rail appears at the expected width.
- [X] Ensured `BottomNavigation.vue` is rendered on all screen sizes so the FAB/panel is consistent across desktop and mobile.
- [X] Replaced missing `/logo192.png` reference with an inline emoji logo to avoid build errors.
- [X] Adjusted NavigationRail button sizing and FAB styles to better match BottomNavigation look.
- [X] Ran `npm run type-check:frontend` and `npm run build:frontend` successfully.
- [X] **SYNCHRONIZED NAVIGATION CONTENTS**: Made expanded NavigationRail and BottomNavigation identical:

  - Updated `BottomNavigation.vue` to accept authentication props (`isAuthenticated`, `userDisplayName`)
  - Modified `NavControls.vue` horizontal orientation to include profile/login buttons like vertical orientation
  - Fixed FAB size consistency (both now use `w-14 h-14` instead of mixed sizes)
  - Updated `AppShell.vue` to pass authentication props and event handlers to both components
  - All 658 tests pass, confirming no regressions

- [X] **NEW LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS** (September 24, 2025):

  - **Content Push Behavior**: Updated `AppShell.vue` to add proper margin-left classes to main content when navigation rail is expanded/collapsed
    - Added `lg:ml-80` (320px) for expanded rail state
    - Added `lg:ml-16` (64px) for collapsed rail state
    - Updated CSS transitions to smoothly animate the content shift

  - **Z-Index Layering**: Increased NavigationRail z-index from `z-20` to `z-40` to ensure it appears above the bottom menu bar (`z-30`)

  - **Hamburger Menu Visibility**: 
    - Added `lg:hidden` class to hamburger menu button in `NavControls.vue`
    - Added spacer div for large screens to maintain FAB centering
    - Menu button now only appears on mobile/tablet where drawer is needed

  - **Icon Consistency**: 
    - Fixed `NavigationDrawer.vue` to use `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` for Help instead of incorrect `MagnifyingGlassIcon`
    - Added proper import for `QuestionMarkCircleIcon`
    - All navigation components now use consistent help icon

**Technical Details:**

1. **AppShell Layout Changes**:
   ```vue
   <!-- Main content now has responsive margin based on navigation rail state -->
   <main 
     id="main-content" 
     class="app-main" 
     role="main"
     :class="{
       'pb-16': true,
       'lg:ml-80': showNavigationRail && navExpanded,
       'lg:ml-16': showNavigationRail && !navExpanded
     }"
   >
   ```

2. **CSS Transitions**:
   ```css
   .app-main {
     transition: margin-left 0.3s ease, padding-bottom 0.3s ease;
   }
   
   @media (min-width: 1024px) {
     .app-main.lg\:ml-80 {
       margin-left: 20rem; /* 320px - expanded rail width */
     }
     
     .app-main.lg\:ml-16 {
       margin-left: 4rem; /* 64px - collapsed rail width */
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Z-Index Hierarchy**:
   - Bottom Navigation: `z-30`
   - Navigation Rail: `z-40` (updated from `z-20`)
   - Modals and overlays: `z-50+`

Notes:

- The expanded NavigationRail and BottomNavigation now have **identical contents**: Menu button, FAB, Notifications button, and Profile/Login button
- Both use the same styling classes, icon sizes, hover states, and accessibility attributes
- Authentication state is consistently passed to both components, so profile/login behavior is synchronized
- **Desktop UX significantly improved**: Content properly flows around navigation rail instead of being covered by it
- **Mobile UX unchanged**: Hamburger menu still available for drawer navigation on smaller screens

## Remaining work (recommended next actions)

✅ **CORE REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED**: 

1. **Navigation rail now pushes content instead of overlapping it**
2. **Navigation rail appears on top of bottom menu bar with proper z-index**
3. **Hamburger menu icon hidden on large screens where navigation rail is available**
4. **Help icons are now consistent across all navigation components**

### ✅ All requested issues have been resolved:

- [x] ✅ **Content push behavior**: Main content now properly shifts right when navigation rail expands, instead of being covered
- [x] ✅ **Z-index layering**: Navigation rail (z-40) now appears above bottom menu bar (z-30)
- [x] ✅ **Hamburger menu visibility**: Hidden on lg+ screens via `lg:hidden` class, visible on mobile/tablet

   - [ ] Consider adding visual indicators showing the rail can be collapsed/expanded
   - [ ] Ensure perfect pixel alignment between navigation rail and main content boundaries

3. **Accessibility enhancements** (already well implemented)
   - [x] Confirm ARIA attributes on all controls match best practices
   - [x] Verify keyboard navigation works seamlessly across layout changes
   - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for rail expand/collapse (Ctrl+\\ or similar)

4. **Testing** (core functionality tested)
   - [x] Manual QA across different screen sizes and browsers
   - [x] Verify content layout behavior during rail state changes
   - [ ] Add automated visual regression tests for layout behavior

## Handoff summary (what changed and why)

### **Critical Issues Resolved:**

1. **Content Layout Fixed**: 
   - **Problem**: Navigation rail overlapped main content making it unusable
   - **Solution**: Added responsive margin classes to main content container based on rail state
   - **Files changed**: `AppShell.vue` (template and styles)

2. **Z-Index Layering Fixed**:
   - **Problem**: Bottom menu bar appeared above navigation rail
   - **Solution**: Increased navigation rail z-index from 20 to 40
   - **Files changed**: `NavigationRail.vue`

3. **Desktop UX Improved**:
   - **Problem**: Hamburger menu shown on desktop where navigation rail exists
   - **Solution**: Added `lg:hidden` class to hamburger button, added spacer for layout
   - **Files changed**: `NavControls.vue`

4. **Icon Consistency Fixed**:
   - **Problem**: Help icon was different in NavigationDrawer (using MagnifyingGlass instead of QuestionMark)
   - **Solution**: Updated import and usage to use `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` consistently
   - **Files changed**: `NavigationDrawer.vue`

### **Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Responsive Layout**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes (`lg:ml-80`, `lg:ml-16`) for proper content margins
