# Data

Where to get information about Public Art

## Open Street Map

I generated a OSM importer that finds all the artwork and downloads them into a JSON file. see `src\lib\data-collection\osm`

This so far has been the best source of general information about art, but it doesn't include photos.

## GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional District)
