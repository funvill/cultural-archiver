# Known things to do

## Data

Where to get information about Public Art

### Open Street Map

I generated a OSM importer that finds all the artwork and downloads them into a JSON file. see `src\lib\data-collection\osm`

This so far has been the best source of general information about art, but it doesn't include photos.

Find people that would be willing to partner with me on this project. Be specific and say that you are NOT looking for monetary support but are looking for in-kind support. Advertisement, recommendations, etc.

- Burrard Arts Foundation, Centre for Digital Media students. They spondered a simlare project in the past. https://intergalactic.com/content/muse-public-art-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com
- Canada Council - They prefer events over resources. The event could be a mass hunt for new art.

- https://www.art-bc.com/

### Art walk / festivals

These are groups doing "Art walks" or festvials. They might be good groups to partner with. Give them the tools that they need then they use our service.

## General

- `support@art.abluestar.com` currently errors out when sending an email to this address. This address should forward to my personal address.
- Check to make sure that the only email address that is public is `support@art.abluestar.com`


- In artwork edit mode, make the description text box 3 times as tall.
- Create a script to remove the deployed recoreds on cloudflare for the frontend and backend workers. These are piling up for no reason.

- Add an artwork for NULL island https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island 

----

- Need to spend some more time on the mobile and experience. I found it difficult to change and edit the tags.

## Prior Art research

- **School Of Cities** - Vancouver public Art
  - https://github.com/schoolofcities/vancouver-public-art
  - The data is just Vancouver public art database
  - I like the way they put a box on the left hand side when you click on an icon instead of just going direct to the artwork page
  - Contact them and say hello, maybe we could do something together.
  - I like how the markers on the map are small and stay the same reliative size as the map scales up and down.
  - The markers are colored making it easy at a glance to see what each marker repersents.

## Marketing and gameafication

- Speak more about the gamification of the system. We want to send people notifications when a artwork that they contributed to or in artwork that they added gets 1,000 views, 10,000 views, etc. Could make them feel really proud that they've added to this social good.

- Look into how I naturalist sends emails out to new members. Follow that list. How are they doing? Engagement with people. Copy their list. Marketing emails

- Look into the calls to actions that google maps does for "good" reviews and populare reviews. Follow their lead

- Use small fixed size icons for the markers for the map. But have some ability to click though overlapping markers.

- This artwork https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?FromArtworkSearch=False&ArtworkId=358 from this list https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ is not in the Vancouver open data public artwork list. Its in the data set but not on the map. something has gone wrong.

## Sign in

- The email should send out a passcode instead of a link. Don't train people to click links in emails. Maybe a magic phrase instead of a magic link.

## Artwork Details page

## Map page

- In the map options, allow for filtering the map markers by the artwork type.

## Admin page

The admin page is a super user that can give moderators permissions to other users.

## Review Queue / Moderate page

- Move the tabs "New Submissions", and "Artwork Edits" to below the Moderate stats. (Simlare to the admin page)
- The "pending review" stat should also include the "Artwork Edits" pending.

## Add artwork

- After a user uploads a photo, they are shown the search results page of artwork nearby. If the user clicks one of the artwork cards from the search results, they should be brought to a logbook submission form. On this page they can submit a new photo and any other information that they want to. This page is identical to the new artwork submission details page but instead of submitting new artwork it submits a logbook entry, and a artwork details update.

- [ ] After uploading artwork, If no artworks are detected nearby the search results. Go straight to add art details page. No reason to show a page that doesn't have any actions.


----

## Mass Import merge tags

- Update the "source_url" value to be clickable as a link. This means it shouldn't search that tag, that link should be clickable.
  - Tags that have urls in them, should be clickable
