# Know things to do

## MVP

- Mass import
- Optimized submit new artwork

## General

- Move all the test files out of the base source folders into test folders

## Artwork Details page

## Map page

- [ ] The map page should remember where what your last location was and the zoom level. So if you refresh the page again, it will return to the old location. Use local storage for this.

## Admin page

The admin page is a super user that can give moderators permissions to other users.

## Review Queue / Moderate page

- Move the tabs "New Submissions", and "Artwork Edits" to below the Moderate stats. (Simlare to the admin page)
- The "pending review" stat should also include the "Artwork Edits" pending.

## App Bar

- In the app bar. Change the "add" to a Camera Icon and make it 3 times larger then all of the other menu items in the app bar. This icon should glow with a fuzzy border. This is the main button people will use and we want to bring attention to it.
- Help, logout, Admin, and Moderator should automaticly be put in to the menu. The menu should always be shown on the right hand side.
