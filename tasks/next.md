## Mass Import


Update tasks\prd-mass-import-system.md to include information about tags from this PRD tasks\prd-artwork-variable-tagging-system.md

Use a tag for the "data source attribution".

Add functionality to set tags for mass imported artworks.

Allow for dry runs of importing, so i can see what the import looks like before actually importing the data set.

Allow for Automatic approval. OR mass approval of these imported artworks and logbook entries.

This PRD has two parts. Creating the tools that all the improt scripts will use. Then creating the import script for tasks\public-art.json vancouver-public-art as an example.
