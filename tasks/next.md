# Know things to do

## MVP

- [x] Variable fields for artwork
- [x] Optimized submit new artwork
- Mass import

## General

- Move all the test files out of the base source folders into test folders
- The github copilot issue started PR. There is an error that `vitest` is not installed. `I see there's an issue with vitest not being found. Let me check if dependencies are installed and try to fix this:`

- `support@art.abluestar.com` currently errors out when sending an email to this address. This address should forward to my personal address.
- Check to make sure that the only email address that is public is `support@art.abluestar.com`

- Need to spend some more time on the mobile and experience. I found it difficult to change and edit the tags.

- The list of creators needs to be a tag instead of a dedicated field.

- Database reset, Need the ability to do a database reset after the inital devlopment has been done. This is a once off script. It keeps the database schema but deletes all the content.

## Prior Art research

- School Of Cities - Vancouver public Art
  - https://github.com/schoolofcities/vancouver-public-art
  - The data is just Vancouver public art database
  - I like the way they put a box on the left hand side when you click on an icon instead of just going direct to the artwork page
  - Contact them and say hello, maybe we could do something together.
  - I like how the markers on the map are small and stay the same reliative size as the map scales up and down.
  - The markers are colored making it easy at a glance to see what each marker repersents.

## Marketing and gameafication

- Speak more about the gamification of the system. We want to send people notifications when a artwork that they contributed to or in artwork that they added gets 1,000 views, 10,000 views, etc. Could make them feel really proud that they've added to this social good.

- Look into how I naturalist sends emails out to new members. Follow that list. How are they doing? Engagement with people. Copy their list. Marketing emails

- Look into the calls to actions that google maps does for "good" reviews and populare reviews. Follow their lead

## Sign in

- The system is not sending out magic links any more. I checked Resend and its not reciving any requests to send out emails.

- The email should send out a passcode instead of a link. Don't train people to click links in emails. Maybe a magic phrase instead of a magic link.

## Artwork Details page

## Map page

- [ ] The map page should remember where what your last location was and the zoom level. So if you refresh the page again, it will return to the old location. Use local storage for this.
- [ ] Allow for an option to cluster or not to cluster pins on the map.

## Admin page

The admin page is a super user that can give moderators permissions to other users.

## Review Queue / Moderate page

- Move the tabs "New Submissions", and "Artwork Edits" to below the Moderate stats. (Simlare to the admin page)
- The "pending review" stat should also include the "Artwork Edits" pending.

## App Bar

- In the app bar. Change the "add" to a Camera Icon and make it 3 times larger then all of the other menu items in the app bar. This icon should glow with a fuzzy border. This is the main button people will use and we want to bring attention to it.
- Help, logout, Admin, and Moderator should automaticly be put in to the menu. The menu should always be shown on the right hand side.

## Choose a name

- Use https://domains.cloudflare.com/ to check if the domain is avlaible
- This is good for brain storming https://namelix.com/app/

## Find partners

Find people that would be willing to partner with me on this project. Be specific and say that you are NOT looking for monetary support but are looking for in-kind support. Advertisement, recommendations, etc.

- Burrard Arts Foundation, Centre for Digital Media students. They spondered a simlare project in the past. https://intergalactic.com/content/muse-public-art-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com
- Canada Council - They prefer events over resources. The event could be a mass hunt for new art.

## Add artwork

- After a user uploads a photo, they are shown the search results page of artwork nearby. If the user clicks one of the artwork cards from the search results, they should be brought to a logbook submission form. On this page they can submit a new photo and any other information that they want to. This page is identical to the new artwork submission details page but instead of submitting new artwork it submits a logbook entry, and a artwork details update.

- [ ] After submitting the artwork, If no nearby art is detected in the search results. Go straight to add art details. One last step to do

- [X] Reorder the artwork submission page . All the information and then gets consent for submitting it. If they don't give consent then don't actually submit the documents to the website. The consent variable needs to be added to the logbook so we know what version of each consent checkbox they accept agreed to.
