# Know things to do

## MVP

- Mass import
- Optimized submit new artwork

## General

- Move all the test files out of the base source folders into test folders
- The github copilot issue started PR. There is an error that `vitest` is not installed. `I see there's an issue with vitest not being found. Let me check if dependencies are installed and try to fix this:`

- `support@art.abluestar.com` currently errors out when sending an email to this address. This address should forward to my personal address.
- Check to make sure that the only email address that is public is `support@art.abluestar.com`.

## Sign in

- The system is not sending out magic links any more. I checked Resend and its not reciving any requests to send out emails.

## Artwork Details page

## Map page

- [ ] The map page should remember where what your last location was and the zoom level. So if you refresh the page again, it will return to the old location. Use local storage for this.
- [ ] Allow for an option to cluster or not to cluster pins on the map.

## Admin page

The admin page is a super user that can give moderators permissions to other users.

## Review Queue / Moderate page

- Move the tabs "New Submissions", and "Artwork Edits" to below the Moderate stats. (Simlare to the admin page)
- The "pending review" stat should also include the "Artwork Edits" pending.

## App Bar

- In the app bar. Change the "add" to a Camera Icon and make it 3 times larger then all of the other menu items in the app bar. This icon should glow with a fuzzy border. This is the main button people will use and we want to bring attention to it.
- Help, logout, Admin, and Moderator should automaticly be put in to the menu. The menu should always be shown on the right hand side.

- Burrard Arts Foundation, Centre for Digital Media students. They spondered a simlare project in the past. https://intergalactic.com/content/muse-public-art-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com
- Canada Council - They prefer events over resources. The event could be a mass hunt for new art.

## Add artwork

- After a user uploads a photo, they are shown the search results page of artwork nearby. If the user clicks one of the artwork cards from the search results, they should be brought to a logbook submission form. On this page they can submit a new photo and any other information that they want to. This page is identical to the new artwork submission details page but instead of submitting new artwork it submits a logbook entry, and a artwork details update.
