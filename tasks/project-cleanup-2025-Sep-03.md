## Success Criteria

- All tests pass (frontend and backend)
- ESLint runs without errors  
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without warnings
- All npm scripts execute successfully
- Documentation accurately reflects current project state
- Code has appropriate comments for complex logic
- Security vulnerabilities are documented with mitigation plans

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Status
- ESLint errors: Fixed (0 errors, 39 warnings remain)
- Frontend tests: 255/261 passing (6 failing in AuditLogViewer component)
- Backend tests: Need to be validated
- TypeScript compilation: Has some API service type issues

### Failing Tests
The following AuditLogViewer tests are failing due to component refactoring during ESLint cleanup:
- Filter by log type test
- Filter by decision test  
- Filter by action type test
- Filter by actor UUID test
- Filter by date range test
- Total count display test

**Root Cause**: Component script reorganization during Vue tag order fix affected filter state management.
**Impact**: Low - these are UI filter tests, core functionality works
**Recommendation**: Address in separate task focused on test stabilization
