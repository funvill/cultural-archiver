- make the hitboxes for the markers on the map larger. People are struggling with tapping the map markers
- The welcome screens needs a way of closing it without going to the help screen. Or the help screen needs. Learn more about this feature button.
- scrolling on the artwork detail page. When you hit the location map it takes your scrolling over a cursor.
- allow people to use the camera icon to take photos as well as upload photos.
- The consent button on the artwork submission page is hard to see. The questionnaires on that page. Also need to be clicklets rather than drop down pocket buttons. And because the page gets covered up by the bottom bar, you can't really see the submit button
