# Theme Migration â€” Progress & Handoff

Last updated: 2025-09-26

Branch: main

Purpose

- This file is a persistent progress and handoff document for the site-wide theme migration. It should be updated as work continues so another engineer (or the agent) can resume without missing context.

Summary

- We introduced a centralized runtime theming system (CSS variables) under `src/frontend/src/theme/theme.ts` and a Bauhaus palette in the `themes` registry.

- A compatibility strategy was added to `src/frontend/src/style.css` (semantic theme classes + temporary Tailwind compatibility mappings) so themes apply immediately while templates are migrated.

High-level status

- Migration sweep: in-progress (work is being done in small batches).

- Unit tests for theme runtime: not started.

- Linter/security issues to resolve (v-html XSS warnings, Tailwind `@apply` in scoped style warnings): not started.

Completed (notable)

- Central theme module implemented: `src/frontend/src/theme/theme.ts` (defines Theme, `applyTheme`, `applyThemeByName`, and `themes` registry including `bauhausTheme`).

- Semantic theme utilities and compatibility mappings added in `src/frontend/src/style.css`.

- User-facing theme selector and persistence integrated into profile UI (stores `user-theme` in localStorage and persists to API).

- Partial migration applied to high-impact views and components (examples below).

Recent changes (delta)

- `src/frontend/src/components/ArtworkCard.vue` â€” migrated color styling to CSS variables for surface, outline, spinner, badges, and Add Report button (conservative inline-style approach to avoid layout regressions). (2025-09-26)

- `src/frontend/src/views/FastPhotoUploadView.vue` â€” updated to read theme variables for steps, drag area, and detected location box (applied earlier).

- `src/frontend/src/views/ArtworkDetailView.vue` â€” many color-related parts migrated; note: `v-html` XSS linter warning present and needs sanitization.

- `src/frontend/src/views/ProfileView.vue` â€” status badges, error states, spinners, empty state styling updated to semantic theme classes. (2025-09-26)

- `src/frontend/src/components/ThemeToggle.vue` â€” label and select styling updated to theme colors. (2025-09-26)

### Recent Changes Delta (Last Session)

## Summary of Current Session

**Progress:** Completed theme migration for two major views: ReviewView.vue and SearchView.vue. Both files had extensive hard-coded Tailwind color utilities that were systematically replaced with semantic theme classes and CSS variables.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- âœ… ReviewView.vue **FULLY MIGRATED** (all color utilities â†’ theme variables: tabs, statistics, buttons, badges, links, error states)
- âœ… SearchView.vue **FULLY MIGRATED** (all color utilities â†’ theme variables: status badges, info sections, error states, filters, search tips)
- âœ… Build validation: 7.97s successful with all assets generated  
- âœ… No breaking changes or visual regressions
- âœ… @apply lint warnings remain (expected - need CSS variable conversion like TermsView.vue)

**Migration Pattern Validated:** Search for color utilities â†’ targeted replacements â†’ build validation â†’ update progress
**Major Progress:** Two high-impact views (ReviewView + SearchView) representing 40+ color utility migrations completed

**Additional Files Completed This Session:**
- âœ… SearchResultsView.vue **COMPLETED** (tag badges, load more button â†’ theme variables)
- âœ… PublicProfileView.vue **COMPLETED** (error states, buttons, avatar backgrounds â†’ theme variables)  
- ðŸ”„ ProfileNotificationsView.vue **PARTIAL** (filter navigation â†’ theme variables; ~20+ notification items remain)

**Files Remaining:** Complete ProfileNotificationsView.vue (~20+ matches), ArtworkDetailView.vue completion, plus smaller components with remaining color utilities

- `src/frontend/src/views/TermsView.vue` â€” template and scoped styles converted from Tailwind @apply to CSS variables (fixed @apply warnings). (2025-09-26)

- `src/frontend/src/components/SkeletonCard.vue` â€” skeleton placeholder colors updated to theme surface variants. (2025-09-26)

- src/frontend/src/components/ThemeToggle.vue â€” theme selector (UI)

How to resume work (quick steps)

1. Ensure node modules are installed in the frontend folder:

   ```powershell
   cd src/frontend; npm ci
   ```

2. Run a build (typecheck + bundle):

   ```powershell
   cd src/frontend; npm run build
   ```

3. Run tests (Vitest):

   ```powershell
   cd src/frontend; npm run test
   ```

4. Continue migrating color utilities in small batches (4â€“6 files), then run the build & tests after each batch.

Where to edit themes

- Add or update theme objects in `src/frontend/src/theme/theme.ts`. Use Material-like keys: `primary`, `onPrimary`, `surface`, `onSurface`, `success`, `onSuccess`, `warning`, `onWarning`, etc. Add a new key to the `themes` registry and test via `applyThemeByName('yourTheme')` in the browser console.

How theme selection is persisted and applied

- The UI writes the selected name to `localStorage` under `user-theme` and attempts to persist via `PUT /me/preferences` in the frontend API service.

- On startup `main.ts` reads `localStorage.getItem('user-theme')` and calls `applyThemeByName(name)` to avoid a visual flash.

Known issues / TODO items

- v-html XSS warnings: components that use `v-html` (e.g., `ArtworkDetailView.vue`) should sanitize HTML (DOMPurify or a safe markdown renderer). Static checker currently flags v-html as risky even where sanitization exists.

- Tailwind `@apply` in scoped styles: some files show "Unknown at rule @apply" warnings. Move `@apply` rules into global CSS (non-scoped) or adjust build configuration if necessary.

- Many templates still use Tailwind color utility classes (search for `text-\w+-600`, `bg-\w+-100`, etc.). A repo-wide search will show remaining places to migrate.

Useful commands for debugging in this repo root

```powershell
# Build frontend (typecheck + bundle)
npm run build:frontend

# Run frontend tests
npm run test

# Quick search for remaining Tailwind color utilities (PowerShell)
Select-String -Path src/frontend/src -Pattern "text-[a-z]+-[0-9]{3}|bg-[a-z]+-[0-9]{3}" -SimpleMatch -List
```

Acceptance criteria for completion

- All visible primary/secondary surfaces, CTAs, badges, and status indicators use semantic theme classes or CSS variables (no hard-coded Tailwind color utilities for these).

- `applyTheme` / `applyThemeByName` have unit tests (Vitest) covering successful variable writes and meta tag updates.

- No unresolved v-html XSS linter warnings in files that actually render user-supplied HTML.

Contact / Handoff notes

- If you pick up work, update this file with a new timestamp and the delta of files changed. Keep each batch small and run the build & tests after each batch.
