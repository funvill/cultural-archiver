# Image Thumbnail Generation System - Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for implementing an image thumbnail generation system for the Cultural Archiver project. The system will automatically generate optimized image variants when photos are uploaded, and provide a migration script to process existing images.

**Status:** Research Phase - Investigating WASM Image Resizing Solutions  
**Created:** October 5, 2025  
**Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Target Release:** TBD

---

## Current Status (October 6, 2025)

### What We've Done
- ‚úÖ Updated medium image size from 800px to 1024px
- ‚úÖ Fixed CORS headers for cross-origin image loading (`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`)
- ‚úÖ Implemented smart variant regeneration logic (checks metadata and regenerates if size mismatches)
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with new 1024px size (692 tests total)
- ‚úÖ Backend deployed (version `30a96933-25e2-4adf-9111-51068511fcd5`)
- ‚úÖ **Implemented WASM image resizing using `wasm-image-optimization`**
  - Replaced non-functional Cloudflare Image Resizing API
  - Uses `optimizeImageExt()` to resize images and return actual dimensions
  - Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF formats with quality control
  - Build successful with zero errors

### Previous Problem (RESOLVED)
**Cloudflare Image Resizing API was not working** because:
- `CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_ENABLED = "false"` in production
- The `fetch` with `cf.image` API requires Cloudflare Image Resizing to be enabled on the account
- Without it, system returned original full-size images even for "medium" requests
- Example: Requesting 1024px medium variant returned 3072x4080 original (3.3MB instead of ~200KB)

**Solution Implemented:** Option 3 - WASM Image Resizing using `wasm-image-optimization`

### Next Step
üöÄ Deploy backend worker to production and test with real images to verify resizing works

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Enable Cloudflare Image Resizing (NOT CHOSEN)
- Requires paid Cloudflare Images subscription
- Would enable `fetch` with `cf.image` API
- Pros: Native Cloudflare solution, well-integrated, fast
- Cons: Additional cost, requires account upgrade

#### Option 2: Serve Originals (NOT CHOSEN)
- Keep current setup, browser handles client-side resizing
- Pros: No code changes needed
- Cons: Wastes bandwidth, slower page loads, poor mobile experience

#### Option 3: Integrate WASM Image Resizing Library ‚≠ê **SELECTED**
- Use WebAssembly-based image processing in Workers
- Pros: No additional Cloudflare costs, full control, works offline
- Cons: More complex implementation, WASM bundle size, CPU usage

## Research: WASM Image Resizing for Cloudflare Workers

### Requirement Constraints
- **Environment**: Cloudflare Workers (V8 isolate, not Node.js)
- **Memory Limit**: 128MB default (can be increased)
- **CPU Time Limit**: 50ms on free plan, 30s on paid plans
- **No Node.js APIs**: Cannot use `fs`, `child_process`, `os.cpus()`, etc.
- **WASM Support**: Full WebAssembly support available
- **Bundle Size**: Should be reasonable (<1MB ideally)

### Libraries Investigated

#### ‚ùå `@squoosh/lib`
- **Status**: Tested and rejected
- **Issue**: Requires Node.js APIs (`node:os`, `node:fs`)
- **Why it failed**: `import { cpus } from 'node:os'` - not available in Workers
- **Bundle size**: ~500KB
- **Conclusion**: Designed for Node.js, not Workers-compatible

#### ‚úÖ `wasm-image-optimization` - **SELECTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Installed and tested successfully
- **Package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wasm-image-optimization
- **Description**: WASM-based image optimization specifically designed for Cloudflare Workers
- **Size**: Small WASM bundle (~150KB)
- **Features**: Resize, compress, format conversion (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF)
- **Compatibility**: ‚úÖ Designed for browser/Workers environments (explicitly supports Cloudflare Workers)
- **API**:
  ```typescript
  optimizeImage({
    image: BufferSource | Buffer | string,
    width?: number,
    height?: number,
    quality?: number, // 0-100
    format?: "jpeg" | "png" | "webp" | "avif",
    speed?: number, // 0-10 (slow-fast)
    filter?: boolean // resize filter (default true)
  }): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
  
  optimizeImageExt({
    // same params as optimizeImage
  }): Promise<{
    data: Uint8Array,
    originalWidth: number,
    originalHeight: number,
    width: number,
    height: number
  }>
  ```
- **Test Results**:
  - ‚úÖ Successfully imports in Workers environment
  - ‚úÖ Exports `optimizeImage` and `optimizeImageExt` functions
  - ‚úÖ Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, thumbhash formats
  - ‚úÖ Returns both data and dimensions with `optimizeImageExt`
  - ‚úÖ No Node.js dependencies
- **Decision**: This library meets all requirements and will be used for implementation

#### üîç Other Options to Research

1. **`wasm-imagemagick`**
   - Full ImageMagick compiled to WASM
   - Pro: Feature-complete image processing
   - Con: Large bundle size (2-5MB)
   - Use case: If we need advanced features beyond resize

2. **`@cf/image` (Cloudflare Workers AI)**
   - Cloudflare's AI/ML models including image processing
   - Pro: Native Cloudflare integration
   - Con: Requires Workers AI subscription
   - Need to research: Pricing and capabilities

3. **`photon-rs` WASM bindings**
   - Rust-based image processing library
   - Pro: Fast, efficient, designed for WASM
   - Con: Need to compile Rust to WASM, larger bundle
   - GitHub: https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon

4. **Custom canvas-based resizing**
   - Use HTML5 Canvas API (available in Workers via `HTMLRewriter`)
   - Pro: No dependencies, lightweight
   - Con: Limited to basic resizing, no advanced compression
   - Viability: Need to verify Canvas API availability in Workers

5. **`image-js/image-js`**
   - Pure JavaScript image processing library
   - Pro: No WASM needed, works everywhere
   - Con: Slower than WASM, larger bundle
   - Use case: Fallback option if WASM solutions fail

- [ ] WASM bundle size <500KB
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 128MB
- [ ] Graceful fallback to original if resize fails

## Open Questions

1. **Workers AI Pricing**: What's the cost per image resize with `@cf/image`?
2. **Bundle Size**: Will WASM bundle cause cold start issues?
3. **Caching**: Should we cache WASM module between requests?
4. **Format Support**: Do we need HEIC/HEIF support for iPhone photos?
5. **Quality Settings**: What JPEG quality gives best size/quality tradeoff?
6. **Concurrent Processing**: Can we resize multiple images in parallel?
7. **Error Handling**: Should failed resizes block upload or fall back to originals?

### 1.2 - On-Demand Image Resizing API

**Objective:** Implement a dynamic, on-demand image resizing and caching system that avoids database schema changes.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Design the on-demand image resizing endpoint
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/images/:size/*`
  - **URL Structure:** `https://api.publicartregistry.com/v1/images/thumb/artworks/2024/01/15/original-image-name.jpg`
  - **Naming Convention:** The resized image will be stored in R2 with a suffix, e.g., `original-image-name__400x400.jpg`.
- [ ] Implement the API endpoint logic in a new route `src/workers/routes/images.ts`
  - The endpoint will parse the `size` and the original image path.
  - It will construct the R2 key for the resized image.
  - It will check if the resized image already exists in the R2 bucket.
  - **If it exists:** Serve the file directly from R2 with a long cache header.
  - **If it does not exist:**
    - Fetch the original image from R2.
    - Use the image processing library to resize it.
    - Upload the new resized image to R2.
    - Serve the newly created image.
  - Implement security to ensure it only processes images from within the R2 bucket.
- [ ] Create a URL helper function for the frontend
  - `getImageSizedURL(originalUrl: string, size: 'thumb' | 'medium' | 'large'): string`
  - This function will construct the appropriate API endpoint URL.
- [ ] Update TypeScript types in `src/shared/types.ts`
  - Add `PhotoVariant` enum type (`original`, `thumbnail`, `medium`, `large`).
- [ ] Test the new endpoint thoroughly
  - Test with various image sizes and formats.
  - Test cache headers and behavior.
  - Test error handling for missing original images.

**Deliverables:**
