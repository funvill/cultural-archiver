# Corrected Cluster Scaling - Larger at Lower Zoom

## Issue Fixed
The cluster scaling was using multipliers that made the progression confusing. Now using direct base sizes that clearly decrease as zoom level increases.

## New Scaling Behavior

### Size Progression (Larger → Smaller as you zoom in)

| Zoom | Base Size | With 100 Points | Description |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| ≤8   | **150px** | 187px | Massive - Continental/State view |
| 9    | **130px** | 167px | Very Large - Regional view |
| 10   | **120px** | 157px | Very Large - Metro area |
| 11   | **100px** | 137px | Large - City view |
| **12** | **80px** | **117px** | **Medium-Large - District view** ⭐ |
| 13   | **60px** | 97px  | Medium - Neighborhood |
| 14   | **45px** | 82px  | Medium-Small - Street cluster |
| 15   | **35px** | 72px  | Small - Last cluster zoom |
| 16+  | **20px** (individual) | N/A | Minimal - Individual markers |

### Visual Size Reference

```
Zoom 8:  🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 (150px base)
Zoom 10: 🔴🔴🔴🔴   (120px base)
Zoom 11: 🔴🔴🔴     (100px base)
Zoom 12: 🔴🔴       (80px base)  ⭐ SWEET SPOT
Zoom 13: 🔴         (60px base)
Zoom 14: 🟠         (45px base)
Zoom 15: 🟡         (35px base)
```

## Why This Is Better

### Clear Progression
**Before (with multipliers):**
- Zoom 8: 100 * 11 = 1100px (capped at 300px)
- Zoom 11: 60 * 8 = 480px (capped at 300px)
- Zoom 12: 45 * 7 = 315px (capped at 300px)
- Confusing - many zoom levels hit the cap

**After (direct sizes):**
- Zoom 8: 150px + point bonus
- Zoom 11: 100px + point bonus
- Zoom 12: 80px + point bonus
- Clear progression - each zoom level distinct

### Zoom 12 Sweet Spot
- **80px base** is perfect for neighborhood/district views
- Large enough to hold hundreds of points
- Small enough to show multiple clusters on screen
- Comfortable tap target for mobile (117px with 100 points)

### Point Count Examples at Zoom 12

| Point Count | Size | Visual |
|-------------|------|--------|
| 10 points   | 99px  | 🔴🔴 Easy to tap |
| 50 points   | 111px | 🔴🔴 Comfortable |
| 100 points  | 117px | 🔴🔴 Clear label |
| 500 points  | 129px | 🔴🔴🔴 Prominent |
| 1000 points | 135px | 🔴🔴🔴 Very prominent |

All sizes fit comfortably within the 300px cap while maintaining clear visual hierarchy!

## Code Implementation

```typescript
let baseSize: number
if (currentZoom <= 8) {
  baseSize = 150  // Massive at very low zoom
} else if (currentZoom <= 10) {
  baseSize = 120  // Very large
} else if (currentZoom <= 11) {
  baseSize = 100  // Large
} else if (currentZoom <= 12) {
  baseSize = 80   // Medium-large ⭐ ZOOM 12
} else if (currentZoom <= 13) {
  baseSize = 60   // Medium
} else if (currentZoom <= 14) {
  baseSize = 45   // Medium-small
} else if (currentZoom <= 15) {
  baseSize = 35   // Small
} else {
  baseSize = 20   // Minimal
}

const countScale = Math.log(pointCount + 1) * 8
const finalSize = baseSize + countScale
return Math.min(finalSize, 300)
```

## Comparison: Old vs New at Zoom 12

### Old System (Multiplier)
- Base: 45 * 7 = 315px (hit cap immediately)
- With 10 points: 300px (capped)
- With 100 points: 300px (capped)
- With 1000 points: 300px (capped)
- **Problem:** All clusters look the same size!

### New System (Direct)
- Base: 80px
- With 10 points: 99px
- With 100 points: 117px
- With 1000 points: 135px
- **Benefit:** Clear visual hierarchy!

## Benefits at All Zoom Levels

### Wide Views (Zoom ≤10)
- 120-150px base ensures visibility
- Can handle thousands of points
- Clear landmarks on map

### City Views (Zoom 11-12)
- 80-100px base is comfortable
- Multiple clusters visible
- Easy to navigate

### Neighborhood Views (Zoom 13-14)
- 45-60px base shows more detail
- Clusters still easily tappable
- Smooth transition to individuals

### Street Views (Zoom 15+)
- 35px clusters or 24px individuals
- Maximum detail
- Precise location

## Summary

✅ **Eliminated confusing multipliers**  
✅ **Direct base sizes for each zoom level**  
✅ **Zoom 12 gets 80px base** (perfect for district views)  
✅ **Clear progression: 150→120→100→80→60→45→35→20px**  
✅ **Point count bonus works properly** (8-50px)  
✅ **No more hitting 300px cap prematurely**  
✅ **Better visual hierarchy at all zoom levels**  

**Result:** Clusters now scale correctly - larger at lower zoom (like zoom 12) and progressively smaller as you zoom in! 🎯
