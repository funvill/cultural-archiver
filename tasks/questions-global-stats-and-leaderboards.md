# Feature Definition: Global Stats and Leaderboards

This document outlines the requirements for the "Global Stats and Leaderboards" feature based on the clarifying questions answered.

## 1. Goals & High-Level Vision

- **Primary Goal:** To increase user engagement and gamify contributions.
- **Primary Audience:** All public visitors and registered users.
- **Timeframes:** The page should support both "All-Time" and "Last 30 Days" views for stats and leaderboards.
- **User Identity:** Contributors will be identified by their unique user ID (UUID). A future enhancement will allow users to set a public nickname.
- **Location:** The feature will be accessible via a new, dedicated "Stats" page in the main application navigation.

## 2. Functional Requirements & Display

- **Global Stats Presentation:** High-level statistics will be presented as a series of prominent "stat cards" at the top of the page.
- **Leaderboard Categories:** There will be separate leaderboards for "New Artworks Submitted", "Edits/Updates Made", and "Photos Added".
- **Leaderboard Size:** Each leaderboard will display the Top 10 users.
- **Leaderboard User Info:** Each entry will show the user's Rank, User Identifier (UUID), and their total count for that category.
- **Timeframe Display:** "All-Time" and "Last 30 Days" leaderboards will be displayed side-by-side for each category for easy comparison.

## 3. Technical & Non-Functional Requirements

- **Data Freshness:** The data will be cached and updated periodically (e.g., every hour).
- **Ties:** Ties in leaderboards will be handled by assigning the same rank and ordering users by their identifier.
- **Data Inclusion:** Only contributions with an "approved" status will be included in the stats.
- **Empty State:** If there is not enough data, a friendly message will be displayed.
- **Exclusions:** Specific, named administrator accounts will be excluded from the leaderboards.

## 4. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Detailed Personal History:** The initial version will not include detailed personal contribution histories or timelines for users.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Users will not be notified in real-time about changes in their leaderboard rank.
- **Custom Leaderboards:** The ability for users to create their own custom leaderboards is out of scope.
- **User Avatars:** User avatars or profile pictures will not be displayed on the leaderboards.
- **Historical Archives:** Archiving and viewing historical leaderboard data (e.g., last month's winners) is not required.
- **Achievements/Badges:** A system for achievements or badges is a separate feature and not included in this scope.
- **Data Visualizations:** The initial version will not include charts, graphs, or other complex data visualizations.
